Because men, groping\\r\\nin the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and\\r\\ntransportation companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing\\r\\ninto the Northland. These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy\\r\\ndogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them\\r\\nfrom the frost.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge\\r\\nMiller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden\\r\\namong the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool\\r\\nveranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled\\r\\ndriveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the\\r\\ninterlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more\\r\\nspacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen\\r\\ngrooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad servants’ cottages, an\\r\\nendless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors, green pastures,\\r\\norchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian\\r\\nwell, and the big cement tank where Judge Miller’s boys took their\\r\\nmorning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd over this great demesne Buck ruled. Here he was born, and here he had lived\\r\\nthe four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs, There could not\\r\\nbut be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count. They came and\\r\\nwent, resided in the populous kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of\\r\\nthe house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican\\r\\nhairless,—strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot\\r\\nto ground. On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at\\r\\nleast, who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the\\r\\nwindows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and\\r\\nmops.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his. He\\r\\nplunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he\\r\\nescorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or\\r\\nearly morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before\\r\\nthe roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s grandsons on his back,\\r\\nor rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild\\r\\nadventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the\\r\\npaddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked\\r\\nimperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was\\r\\nking,—king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge\\r\\nMiller’s place, humans included.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable\\r\\ncompanion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. He was not so\\r\\nlarge,—he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,—for his\\r\\nmother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and\\r\\nforty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and\\r\\nuniversal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During\\r\\nthe four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat;\\r\\nhe had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country\\r\\ngentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved\\r\\nhimself by not becoming a mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor\\r\\ndelights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the\\r\\ncold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd this was the manner of dog Buck was in the fall of 1897, when the Klondike\\r\\nstrike dragged men from all the world into the frozen North. But Buck did not\\r\\nread the newspapers, and he did not know that Manuel, one of the\\r\\ngardener’s helpers, was an undesirable acquaintance. Manuel had one\\r\\nbesetting sin. He loved to play Chinese lottery. Also, in his gambling, he had\\r\\none besetting weakness—faith in a system; and this made his damnation\\r\\ncertain. For to play a system requires money, while the wages of a\\r\\ngardener’s helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous\\r\\nprogeny.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers’ Association, and the\\r\\nboys were busy organizing an athletic club, on the memorable night of\\r\\nManuel’s treachery. No one saw him and Buck go off through the orchard on\\r\\nwhat Buck imagined was merely a stroll. And with the exception of a solitary\\r\\nman, no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known as College Park.\\r\\nThis man talked with Manuel, and money chinked between them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You might wrap up the goods before you deliver ’m,” the\\r\\nstranger said gruffly, and Manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around\\r\\nBuck’s neck under the collar.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Twist it, an’ you’ll choke ’m plentee,” said\\r\\nManuel, and the stranger grunted a ready affirmative.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity. To be sure, it was an unwonted\\r\\nperformance: but he had learned to trust in men he knew, and to give them\\r\\ncredit for a wisdom that outreached his own. But when the ends of the rope were\\r\\nplaced in the stranger’s hands, he growled menacingly. He had merely\\r\\nintimated his displeasure, in his pride believing that to intimate was to\\r\\ncommand. But to his surprise the rope tightened around his neck, shutting off\\r\\nhis breath. In quick rage he sprang at the man, who met him halfway, grappled\\r\\nhim close by the throat, and with a deft twist threw him over on his back. Then\\r\\nthe rope tightened mercilessly, while Buck struggled in a fury, his tongue\\r\\nlolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely. Never in all his\\r\\nlife had he been so vilely treated, and never in all his life had he been so\\r\\nangry. But his strength ebbed, his eyes glazed, and he knew nothing when the\\r\\ntrain was flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe next he knew, he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and that he\\r\\nwas being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance. The hoarse shriek of a\\r\\nlocomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was. He had travelled too\\r\\noften with the Judge not to know the sensation of riding in a baggage car. He\\r\\nopened his eyes, and into them came the unbridled anger of a kidnapped king.\\r\\nThe man sprang for his throat, but Buck was too quick for him. His jaws closed\\r\\non the hand, nor did they relax till his senses were choked out of him once\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yep, has fits,” the man said, hiding his mangled hand from the\\r\\nbaggageman, who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle. “I’m\\r\\ntakin’ ’m up for the boss to ’Frisco. A crack dog-doctor\\r\\nthere thinks that he can cure ’m.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nConcerning that night’s ride, the man spoke most eloquently for himself,\\r\\nin a little shed back of a saloon on the San Francisco water front.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“All I get is fifty for it,” he grumbled; “an’ I\\r\\nwouldn’t do it over for a thousand, cold cash.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief, and the right trouser leg was\\r\\nripped from knee to ankle.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How much did the other mug get?” the saloon-keeper demanded.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A hundred,” was the reply. “Wouldn’t take a sou less,\\r\\nso help me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That makes a hundred and fifty,” the saloon-keeper calculated;\\r\\n“and he’s worth it, or I’m a squarehead.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated hand.\\r\\n“If I don’t get the hydrophoby—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’ll be because you was born to hang,” laughed the\\r\\nsaloon-keeper. “Here, lend me a hand before you pull your freight,”\\r\\nhe added.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDazed, suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue, with the life half\\r\\nthrottled out of him, Buck attempted to face his tormentors. But he was thrown\\r\\ndown and choked repeatedly, till they succeeded in filing the heavy brass\\r\\ncollar from off his neck. Then the rope was removed, and he was flung into a\\r\\ncagelike crate.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere he lay for the remainder of the weary night, nursing his wrath and\\r\\nwounded pride. He could not understand what it all meant. What did they want\\r\\nwith him, these strange men? Why were they keeping him pent up in this narrow\\r\\ncrate? He did not know why, but he felt oppressed by the vague sense of\\r\\nimpending calamity. Several times during the night he sprang to his feet when\\r\\nthe shed door rattled open, expecting to see the Judge, or the boys at least.\\r\\nBut each time it was the bulging face of the saloon-keeper that peered in at\\r\\nhim by the sickly light of a tallow candle. And each time the joyful bark that\\r\\ntrembled in Buck’s throat was twisted into a savage growl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the saloon-keeper let him alone, and in the morning four men entered and\\r\\npicked up the crate. More tormentors, Buck decided, for they were evil-looking\\r\\ncreatures, ragged and unkempt; and he stormed and raged at them through the\\r\\nbars. They only laughed and poked sticks at him, which he promptly assailed\\r\\nwith his teeth till he realized that that was what they wanted. Whereupon he\\r\\nlay down sullenly and allowed the crate to be lifted into a wagon. Then he, and\\r\\nthe crate in which he was imprisoned, began a passage through many hands.\\r\\nClerks in the express office took charge of him; he was carted about in another\\r\\nwagon; a truck carried him, with an assortment of boxes and parcels, upon a\\r\\nferry steamer; he was trucked off the steamer into a great railway depot, and\\r\\nfinally he was deposited in an express car.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail of\\r\\nshrieking locomotives; and for two days and nights Buck neither ate nor drank.\\r\\nIn his anger he had met the first advances of the express messengers with\\r\\ngrowls, and they had retaliated by teasing him. When he flung himself against\\r\\nthe bars, quivering and frothing, they laughed at him and taunted him. They\\r\\ngrowled and barked like detestable dogs, mewed, and flapped their arms and\\r\\ncrowed. It was all very silly, he knew; but therefore the more outrage to his\\r\\ndignity, and his anger waxed and waxed. He did not mind the hunger so much, but\\r\\nthe lack of water caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to\\r\\nfever-pitch. For that matter, high-strung and finely sensitive, the ill\\r\\ntreatment had flung him into a fever, which was fed by the inflammation of his\\r\\nparched and swollen throat and tongue.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe was glad for one thing: the rope was off his neck. That had given them an\\r\\nunfair advantage; but now that it was off, he would show them. They would never\\r\\nget another rope around his neck. Upon that he was resolved. For two days and\\r\\nnights he neither ate nor drank, and during those two days and nights of\\r\\ntorment, he accumulated a fund of wrath that boded ill for whoever first fell\\r\\nfoul of him. His eyes turned blood-shot, and he was metamorphosed into a raging\\r\\nfiend. So changed was he that the Judge himself would not have recognized him;\\r\\nand the express messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the\\r\\ntrain at Seattle.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFour men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small, high-walled\\r\\nback yard. A stout man, with a red sweater that sagged generously at the neck,\\r\\ncame out and signed the book for the driver. That was the man, Buck divined,\\r\\nthe next tormentor, and he hurled himself savagely against the bars. The man\\r\\nsmiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You ain’t going to take him out now?” the driver asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sure,” the man replied, driving the hatchet into the crate for a\\r\\npry.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried it in,\\r\\nand from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the performance.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck rushed at the splintering wood, sinking his teeth into it, surging and\\r\\nwrestling with it. Wherever the hatchet fell on the outside, he was there on\\r\\nthe inside, snarling and growling, as furiously anxious to get out as the man\\r\\nin the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now, you red-eyed devil,” he said, when he had made an opening\\r\\nsufficient for the passage of Buck’s body. At the same time he dropped\\r\\nthe hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Buck was truly a red-eyed devil, as he drew himself together for the\\r\\nspring, hair bristling, mouth foaming, a mad glitter in his blood-shot eyes.\\r\\nStraight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds of fury,\\r\\nsurcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights. In mid air, just as\\r\\nhis jaws were about to close on the man, he received a shock that checked his\\r\\nbody and brought his teeth together with an agonizing clip. He whirled over,\\r\\nfetching the ground on his back and side. He had never been struck by a club in\\r\\nhis life, and did not understand. With a snarl that was part bark and more\\r\\nscream he was again on his feet and launched into the air. And again the shock\\r\\ncame and he was brought crushingly to the ground. This time he was aware that\\r\\nit was the club, but his madness knew no caution. A dozen times he charged, and\\r\\nas often the club broke the charge and smashed him down.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter a particularly fierce blow, he crawled to his feet, too dazed to rush. He\\r\\nstaggered limply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears, his\\r\\nbeautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver. Then the man advanced\\r\\nand deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose. All the pain he had\\r\\nendured was as nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this. With a roar\\r\\nthat was almost lionlike in its ferocity, he again hurled himself at the man.\\r\\nBut the man, shifting the club from right to left, coolly caught him by the\\r\\nunder jaw, at the same time wrenching downward and backward. Buck described a\\r\\ncomplete circle in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on\\r\\nhis head and chest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor the last time he rushed. The man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely\\r\\nwithheld for so long, and Buck crumpled up and went down, knocked utterly\\r\\nsenseless.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He’s no slouch at dog-breakin’, that’s wot I\\r\\nsay,” one of the men on the wall cried enthusiastically.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Druther break cayuses any day, and twice on Sundays,” was the\\r\\nreply of the driver, as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck’s senses came back to him, but not his strength. He lay where he had\\r\\nfallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Answers to the name of Buck,’” the man soliloquized,\\r\\nquoting from the saloon-keeper’s letter which had announced the\\r\\nconsignment of the crate and contents. “Well, Buck, my boy,” he\\r\\nwent on in a genial voice, “we’ve had our little ruction, and the\\r\\nbest thing we can do is to let it go at that. You’ve learned your place,\\r\\nand I know mine. Be a good dog and all ’ll go well and the goose hang\\r\\nhigh. Be a bad dog, and I’ll whale the stuffin’ outa you.\\r\\nUnderstand?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded, and\\r\\nthough Buck’s hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand, he\\r\\nendured it without protest. When the man brought him water he drank eagerly,\\r\\nand later bolted a generous meal of raw meat, chunk by chunk, from the\\r\\nman’s hand.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe was beaten (he knew that); but he was not broken. He saw, once for all, that\\r\\nhe stood no chance against a man with a club. He had learned the lesson, and in\\r\\nall his after life he never forgot it. That club was a revelation. It was his\\r\\nintroduction to the reign of primitive law, and he met the introduction\\r\\nhalfway. The facts of life took on a fiercer aspect; and while he faced that\\r\\naspect uncowed, he faced it with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused.\\r\\nAs the days went by, other dogs came, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some\\r\\ndocilely, and some raging and roaring as he had come; and, one and all, he\\r\\nwatched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater. Again and\\r\\nagain, as he looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven home to\\r\\nBuck: a man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed, though not\\r\\nnecessarily conciliated. Of this last Buck was never guilty, though he did see\\r\\nbeaten dogs that fawned upon the man, and wagged their tails, and licked his\\r\\nhand. Also he saw one dog, that would neither conciliate nor obey, finally\\r\\nkilled in the struggle for mastery.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, wheedlingly, and in\\r\\nall kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater. And at such times that\\r\\nmoney passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with\\r\\nthem. Buck wondered where they went, for they never came back; but the fear of\\r\\nthe future was strong upon him, and he was glad each time when he was not\\r\\nselected.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYet his time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man who spat\\r\\nbroken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which Buck could not\\r\\nunderstand.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sacredam!” he cried, when his eyes lit upon Buck. “Dat one\\r\\ndam bully dog! Eh? How moch?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Three hundred, and a present at that,” was the prompt reply of the\\r\\nman in the red sweater. “And seem’ it’s government money, you\\r\\nain’t got no kick coming, eh, Perrault?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPerrault grinned. Considering that the price of dogs had been boomed skyward by\\r\\nthe unwonted demand, it was not an unfair sum for so fine an animal. The\\r\\nCanadian Government would be no loser, nor would its despatches travel the\\r\\nslower. Perrault knew dogs, and when he looked at Buck he knew that he was one\\r\\nin a thousand—“One in ten t’ousand,” he commented\\r\\nmentally.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when Curly, a\\r\\ngood-natured Newfoundland, and he were led away by the little weazened man.\\r\\nThat was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater, and as Curly and he\\r\\nlooked at receding Seattle from the deck of the Narwhal, it was the last\\r\\nhe saw of the warm Southland. Curly and he were taken below by Perrault and\\r\\nturned over to a black-faced giant called François. Perrault was a\\r\\nFrench-Canadian, and swarthy; but François was a French-Canadian half-breed,\\r\\nand twice as swarthy. They were a new kind of men to Buck (of which he was\\r\\ndestined to see many more), and while he developed no affection for them, he\\r\\nnone the less grew honestly to respect them. He speedily learned that Perrault\\r\\nand François were fair men, calm and impartial in administering justice, and\\r\\ntoo wise in the way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the ’tween-decks of the Narwhal, Buck and Curly joined two\\r\\nother dogs. One of them was a big, snow-white fellow from Spitzbergen who had\\r\\nbeen brought away by a whaling captain, and who had later accompanied a\\r\\nGeological Survey into the Barrens. He was friendly, in a treacherous sort of\\r\\nway, smiling into one’s face the while he meditated some underhand trick,\\r\\nas, for instance, when he stole from Buck’s food at the first meal. As\\r\\nBuck sprang to punish him, the lash of François’s whip sang through the\\r\\nair, reaching the culprit first; and nothing remained to Buck but to recover\\r\\nthe bone. That was fair of François, he decided, and the half-breed began his\\r\\nrise in Buck’s estimation.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe other dog made no advances, nor received any; also, he did not attempt to\\r\\nsteal from the newcomers. He was a gloomy, morose fellow, and he showed Curly\\r\\nplainly that all he desired was to be left alone, and further, that there would\\r\\nbe trouble if he were not left alone. “Dave” he was called, and he\\r\\nate and slept, or yawned between times, and took interest in nothing, not even\\r\\nwhen the Narwhal crossed Queen Charlotte Sound and rolled and pitched\\r\\nand bucked like a thing possessed. When Buck and Curly grew excited, half wild\\r\\nwith fear, he raised his head as though annoyed, favored them with an incurious\\r\\nglance, yawned, and went to sleep again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDay and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller, and\\r\\nthough one day was very like another, it was apparent to Buck that the weather\\r\\nwas steadily growing colder. At last, one morning, the propeller was quiet, and\\r\\nthe Narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere of excitement. He felt it,\\r\\nas did the other dogs, and knew that a change was at hand. François leashed\\r\\nthem and brought them on deck. At the first step upon the cold surface,\\r\\nBuck’s feet sank into a white mushy something very like mud. He sprang\\r\\nback with a snort. More of this white stuff was falling through the air. He\\r\\nshook himself, but more of it fell upon him. He sniffed it curiously, then\\r\\nlicked some up on his tongue. It bit like fire, and the next instant was gone.\\r\\nThis puzzled him. He tried it again, with the same result. The onlookers\\r\\nlaughed uproariously, and he felt ashamed, he knew not why, for it was his\\r\\nfirst snow.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter II.',\n"," 'The Law of Club and Fang\\n\\r\\nBuck’s first day on the Dyea beach was like a nightmare. Every hour was\\r\\nfilled with shock and surprise. He had been suddenly jerked from the heart of\\r\\ncivilization and flung into the heart of things primordial. No lazy, sun-kissed\\r\\nlife was this, with nothing to do but loaf and be bored. Here was neither\\r\\npeace, nor rest, nor a moment’s safety. All was confusion and action, and\\r\\nevery moment life and limb were in peril. There was imperative need to be\\r\\nconstantly alert; for these dogs and men were not town dogs and men. They were\\r\\nsavages, all of them, who knew no law but the law of club and fang.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought, and his first\\r\\nexperience taught him an unforgetable lesson. It is true, it was a vicarious\\r\\nexperience, else he would not have lived to profit by it. Curly was the victim.\\r\\nThey were camped near the log store, where she, in her friendly way, made\\r\\nadvances to a husky dog the size of a full-grown wolf, though not half so large\\r\\nas she. There was no warning, only a leap in like a flash, a metallic clip of\\r\\nteeth, a leap out equally swift, and Curly’s face was ripped open from\\r\\neye to jaw.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was the wolf manner of fighting, to strike and leap away; but there was more\\r\\nto it than this. Thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and surrounded the\\r\\ncombatants in an intent and silent circle. Buck did not comprehend that silent\\r\\nintentness, nor the eager way with which they were licking their chops. Curly\\r\\nrushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside. He met her next rush\\r\\nwith his chest, in a peculiar fashion that tumbled her off her feet. She never\\r\\nregained them, This was what the onlooking huskies had waited for. They closed\\r\\nin upon her, snarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony,\\r\\nbeneath the bristling mass of bodies.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo sudden was it, and so unexpected, that Buck was taken aback. He saw Spitz\\r\\nrun out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing; and he saw François,\\r\\nswinging an axe, spring into the mess of dogs. Three men with clubs were\\r\\nhelping him to scatter them. It did not take long. Two minutes from the time\\r\\nCurly went down, the last of her assailants were clubbed off. But she lay there\\r\\nlimp and lifeless in the bloody, trampled snow, almost literally torn to\\r\\npieces, the swart half-breed standing over her and cursing horribly. The scene\\r\\noften came back to Buck to trouble him in his sleep. So that was the way. No\\r\\nfair play. Once down, that was the end of you. Well, he would see to it that he\\r\\nnever went down. Spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again, and from that\\r\\nmoment Buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBefore he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing of Curly,\\r\\nhe received another shock. François fastened upon him an arrangement of straps\\r\\nand buckles. It was a harness, such as he had seen the grooms put on the horses\\r\\nat home. And as he had seen horses work, so he was set to work, hauling\\r\\nFrançois on a sled to the forest that fringed the valley, and returning with a\\r\\nload of firewood. Though his dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a\\r\\ndraught animal, he was too wise to rebel. He buckled down with a will and did\\r\\nhis best, though it was all new and strange. François was stern, demanding\\r\\ninstant obedience, and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience; while\\r\\nDave, who was an experienced wheeler, nipped Buck’s hind quarters\\r\\nwhenever he was in error. Spitz was the leader, likewise experienced, and while\\r\\nhe could not always get at Buck, he growled sharp reproof now and again, or\\r\\ncunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk Buck into the way he should\\r\\ngo. Buck learned easily, and under the combined tuition of his two mates and\\r\\nFrançois made remarkable progress. Ere they returned to camp he knew enough to\\r\\nstop at “ho,” to go ahead at “mush,” to swing wide on\\r\\nthe bends, and to keep clear of the wheeler when the loaded sled shot downhill\\r\\nat their heels.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“T’ree vair’ good dogs,” François told Perrault.\\r\\n“Dat Buck, heem pool lak hell. I tich heem queek as\\r\\nanyt’ing.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBy afternoon, Perrault, who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his\\r\\ndespatches, returned with two more dogs. “Billee” and\\r\\n“Joe” he called them, two brothers, and true huskies both. Sons of\\r\\nthe one mother though they were, they were as different as day and night.\\r\\nBillee’s one fault was his excessive good nature, while Joe was the very\\r\\nopposite, sour and introspective, with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye.\\r\\nBuck received them in comradely fashion, Dave ignored them, while Spitz\\r\\nproceeded to thrash first one and then the other. Billee wagged his tail\\r\\nappeasingly, turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no avail, and\\r\\ncried (still appeasingly) when Spitz’s sharp teeth scored his flank. But\\r\\nno matter how Spitz circled, Joe whirled around on his heels to face him, mane\\r\\nbristling, ears laid back, lips writhing and snarling, jaws clipping together\\r\\nas fast as he could snap, and eyes diabolically gleaming—the incarnation\\r\\nof belligerent fear. So terrible was his appearance that Spitz was forced to\\r\\nforego disciplining him; but to cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the\\r\\ninoffensive and wailing Billee and drove him to the confines of the camp.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBy evening Perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean and gaunt,\\r\\nwith a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a warning of prowess\\r\\nthat commanded respect. He was called Sol-leks, which means the Angry One. Like\\r\\nDave, he asked nothing, gave nothing, expected nothing; and when he marched\\r\\nslowly and deliberately into their midst, even Spitz left him alone. He had one\\r\\npeculiarity which Buck was unlucky enough to discover. He did not like to be\\r\\napproached on his blind side. Of this offence Buck was unwittingly guilty, and\\r\\nthe first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when Sol-leks whirled upon\\r\\nhim and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down. Forever\\r\\nafter Buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of their comradeship had no\\r\\nmore trouble. His only apparent ambition, like Dave’s, was to be left\\r\\nalone; though, as Buck was afterward to learn, each of them possessed one other\\r\\nand even more vital ambition.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThat night Buck faced the great problem of sleeping. The tent, illumined by a\\r\\ncandle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain; and when he, as a matter\\r\\nof course, entered it, both Perrault and François bombarded him with curses and\\r\\ncooking utensils, till he recovered from his consternation and fled\\r\\nignominiously into the outer cold. A chill wind was blowing that nipped him\\r\\nsharply and bit with especial venom into his wounded shoulder. He lay down on\\r\\nthe snow and attempted to sleep, but the frost soon drove him shivering to his\\r\\nfeet. Miserable and disconsolate, he wandered about among the many tents, only\\r\\nto find that one place was as cold as another. Here and there savage dogs\\r\\nrushed upon him, but he bristled his neck-hair and snarled (for he was learning\\r\\nfast), and they let him go his way unmolested.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFinally an idea came to him. He would return and see how his own team-mates\\r\\nwere making out. To his astonishment, they had disappeared. Again he wandered\\r\\nabout through the great camp, looking for them, and again he returned. Were\\r\\nthey in the tent? No, that could not be, else he would not have been driven\\r\\nout. Then where could they possibly be? With drooping tail and shivering body,\\r\\nvery forlorn indeed, he aimlessly circled the tent. Suddenly the snow gave way\\r\\nbeneath his fore legs and he sank down. Something wriggled under his feet. He\\r\\nsprang back, bristling and snarling, fearful of the unseen and unknown. But a\\r\\nfriendly little yelp reassured him, and he went back to investigate. A whiff of\\r\\nwarm air ascended to his nostrils, and there, curled up under the snow in a\\r\\nsnug ball, lay Billee. He whined placatingly, squirmed and wriggled to show his\\r\\ngood will and intentions, and even ventured, as a bribe for peace, to lick\\r\\nBuck’s face with his warm wet tongue.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnother lesson. So that was the way they did it, eh? Buck confidently selected\\r\\na spot, and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a hole for\\r\\nhimself. In a trice the heat from his body filled the confined space and he was\\r\\nasleep. The day had been long and arduous, and he slept soundly and\\r\\ncomfortably, though he growled and barked and wrestled with bad dreams.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp. At first\\r\\nhe did not know where he was. It had snowed during the night and he was\\r\\ncompletely buried. The snow walls pressed him on every side, and a great surge\\r\\nof fear swept through him—the fear of the wild thing for the trap. It was\\r\\na token that he was harking back through his own life to the lives of his\\r\\nforebears; for he was a civilized dog, an unduly civilized dog, and of his own\\r\\nexperience knew no trap and so could not of himself fear it. The muscles of his\\r\\nwhole body contracted spasmodically and instinctively, the hair on his neck and\\r\\nshoulders stood on end, and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into\\r\\nthe blinding day, the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud. Ere he landed\\r\\non his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew where he was\\r\\nand remembered all that had passed from the time he went for a stroll with\\r\\nManuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night before.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA shout from François hailed his appearance. “Wot I say?” the\\r\\ndog-driver cried to Perrault. “Dat Buck for sure learn queek as\\r\\nanyt’ing.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPerrault nodded gravely. As courier for the Canadian Government, bearing\\r\\nimportant despatches, he was anxious to secure the best dogs, and he was\\r\\nparticularly gladdened by the possession of Buck.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThree more huskies were added to the team inside an hour, making a total of\\r\\nnine, and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in harness and\\r\\nswinging up the trail toward the Dyea Cañon. Buck was glad to be gone, and\\r\\nthough the work was hard he found he did not particularly despise it. He was\\r\\nsurprised at the eagerness which animated the whole team and which was\\r\\ncommunicated to him; but still more surprising was the change wrought in Dave\\r\\nand Sol-leks. They were new dogs, utterly transformed by the harness. All\\r\\npassiveness and unconcern had dropped from them. They were alert and active,\\r\\nanxious that the work should go well, and fiercely irritable with whatever, by\\r\\ndelay or confusion, retarded that work. The toil of the traces seemed the\\r\\nsupreme expression of their being, and all that they lived for and the only\\r\\nthing in which they took delight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDave was wheeler or sled dog, pulling in front of him was Buck, then came\\r\\nSol-leks; the rest of the team was strung out ahead, single file, to the\\r\\nleader, which position was filled by Spitz.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck had been purposely placed between Dave and Sol-leks so that he might\\r\\nreceive instruction. Apt scholar that he was, they were equally apt teachers,\\r\\nnever allowing him to linger long in error, and enforcing their teaching with\\r\\ntheir sharp teeth. Dave was fair and very wise. He never nipped Buck without\\r\\ncause, and he never failed to nip him when he stood in need of it. As\\r\\nFrançois’s whip backed him up, Buck found it to be cheaper to mend his\\r\\nways than to retaliate. Once, during a brief halt, when he got tangled in the\\r\\ntraces and delayed the start, both Dave and Sol-leks flew at him and\\r\\nadministered a sound trouncing. The resulting tangle was even worse, but Buck\\r\\ntook good care to keep the traces clear thereafter; and ere the day was done,\\r\\nso well had he mastered his work, his mates about ceased nagging him.\\r\\nFrançois’s whip snapped less frequently, and Perrault even honored Buck\\r\\nby lifting up his feet and carefully examining them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was a hard day’s run, up the Cañon, through Sheep Camp, past the\\r\\nScales and the timber line, across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of feet\\r\\ndeep, and over the great Chilcoot Divide, which stands between the salt water\\r\\nand the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely North. They made good\\r\\ntime down the chain of lakes which fills the craters of extinct volcanoes, and\\r\\nlate that night pulled into the huge camp at the head of Lake Bennett, where\\r\\nthousands of goldseekers were building boats against the break-up of the ice in\\r\\nthe spring. Buck made his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted\\r\\njust, but all too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with\\r\\nhis mates to the sled.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThat day they made forty miles, the trail being packed; but the next day, and\\r\\nfor many days to follow, they broke their own trail, worked harder, and made\\r\\npoorer time. As a rule, Perrault travelled ahead of the team, packing the snow\\r\\nwith webbed shoes to make it easier for them. François, guiding the sled at the\\r\\ngee-pole, sometimes exchanged places with him, but not often. Perrault was in a\\r\\nhurry, and he prided himself on his knowledge of ice, which knowledge was\\r\\nindispensable, for the fall ice was very thin, and where there was swift water,\\r\\nthere was no ice at all.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDay after day, for days unending, Buck toiled in the traces. Always, they broke\\r\\ncamp in the dark, and the first gray of dawn found them hitting the trail with\\r\\nfresh miles reeled off behind them. And always they pitched camp after dark,\\r\\neating their bit of fish, and crawling to sleep into the snow. Buck was\\r\\nravenous. The pound and a half of sun-dried salmon, which was his ration for\\r\\neach day, seemed to go nowhere. He never had enough, and suffered from\\r\\nperpetual hunger pangs. Yet the other dogs, because they weighed less and were\\r\\nborn to the life, received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good\\r\\ncondition.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old life. A\\r\\ndainty eater, he found that his mates, finishing first, robbed him of his\\r\\nunfinished ration. There was no defending it. While he was fighting off two or\\r\\nthree, it was disappearing down the throats of the others. To remedy this, he\\r\\nate as fast as they; and, so greatly did hunger compel him, he was not above\\r\\ntaking what did not belong to him. He watched and learned. When he saw Pike,\\r\\none of the new dogs, a clever malingerer and thief, slyly steal a slice of\\r\\nbacon when Perrault’s back was turned, he duplicated the performance the\\r\\nfollowing day, getting away with the whole chunk. A great uproar was raised,\\r\\nbut he was unsuspected; while Dub, an awkward blunderer who was always getting\\r\\ncaught, was punished for Buck’s misdeed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis first theft marked Buck as fit to survive in the hostile Northland\\r\\nenvironment. It marked his adaptability, his capacity to adjust himself to\\r\\nchanging conditions, the lack of which would have meant swift and terrible\\r\\ndeath. It marked, further, the decay or going to pieces of his moral nature, a\\r\\nvain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for existence. It was all\\r\\nwell enough in the Southland, under the law of love and fellowship, to respect\\r\\nprivate property and personal feelings; but in the Northland, under the law of\\r\\nclub and fang, whoso took such things into account was a fool, and in so far as\\r\\nhe observed them he would fail to prosper.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNot that Buck reasoned it out. He was fit, that was all, and unconsciously he\\r\\naccommodated himself to the new mode of life. All his days, no matter what the\\r\\nodds, he had never run from a fight. But the club of the man in the red sweater\\r\\nhad beaten into him a more fundamental and primitive code. Civilized, he could\\r\\nhave died for a moral consideration, say the defence of Judge Miller’s\\r\\nriding-whip; but the completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by\\r\\nhis ability to flee from the defence of a moral consideration and so save his\\r\\nhide. He did not steal for joy of it, but because of the clamor of his stomach.\\r\\nHe did not rob openly, but stole secretly and cunningly, out of respect for\\r\\nclub and fang. In short, the things he did were done because it was easier to\\r\\ndo them than not to do them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis development (or retrogression) was rapid. His muscles became hard as iron,\\r\\nand he grew callous to all ordinary pain. He achieved an internal as well as\\r\\nexternal economy. He could eat anything, no matter how loathsome or\\r\\nindigestible; and, once eaten, the juices of his stomach extracted the last\\r\\nleast particle of nutriment; and his blood carried it to the farthest reaches\\r\\nof his body, building it into the toughest and stoutest of tissues. Sight and\\r\\nscent became remarkably keen, while his hearing developed such acuteness that\\r\\nin his sleep he heard the faintest sound and knew whether it heralded peace or\\r\\nperil. He learned to bite the ice out with his teeth when it collected between\\r\\nhis toes; and when he was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice over the\\r\\nwater hole, he would break it by rearing and striking it with stiff fore legs.\\r\\nHis most conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the wind and forecast it a\\r\\nnight in advance. No matter how breathless the air when he dug his nest by tree\\r\\nor bank, the wind that later blew inevitably found him to leeward, sheltered\\r\\nand snug.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd not only did he learn by experience, but instincts long dead became alive\\r\\nagain. The domesticated generations fell from him. In vague ways he remembered\\r\\nback to the youth of the breed, to the time the wild dogs ranged in packs\\r\\nthrough the primeval forest and killed their meat as they ran it down. It was\\r\\nno task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap.\\r\\nIn this manner had fought forgotten ancestors. They quickened the old life\\r\\nwithin him, and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the\\r\\nbreed were his tricks. They came to him without effort or discovery, as though\\r\\nthey had been his always. And when, on the still cold nights, he pointed his\\r\\nnose at a star and howled long and wolflike, it was his ancestors, dead and\\r\\ndust, pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through\\r\\nhim. And his cadences were their cadences, the cadences which voiced their woe\\r\\nand what to them was the meaning of the stiffness, and the cold, and dark.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus, as token of what a puppet thing life is, the ancient song surged through\\r\\nhim and he came into his own again; and he came because men had found a yellow\\r\\nmetal in the North, and because Manuel was a gardener’s helper whose\\r\\nwages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers small copies of\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter III.',\n"," 'The Dominant Primordial Beast\\n\\r\\nThe dominant primordial beast was strong in Buck, and under the fierce\\r\\nconditions of trail life it grew and grew. Yet it was a secret growth. His\\r\\nnewborn cunning gave him poise and control. He was too busy adjusting himself\\r\\nto the new life to feel at ease, and not only did he not pick fights, but he\\r\\navoided them whenever possible. A certain deliberateness characterized his\\r\\nattitude. He was not prone to rashness and precipitate action; and in the\\r\\nbitter hatred between him and Spitz he betrayed no impatience, shunned all\\r\\noffensive acts.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, possibly because he divined in Buck a dangerous rival, Spitz\\r\\nnever lost an opportunity of showing his teeth. He even went out of his way to\\r\\nbully Buck, striving constantly to start the fight which could end only in the\\r\\ndeath of one or the other. Early in the trip this might have taken place had it\\r\\nnot been for an unwonted accident. At the end of this day they made a bleak and\\r\\nmiserable camp on the shore of Lake Le Barge. Driving snow, a wind that cut\\r\\nlike a white-hot knife, and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping\\r\\nplace. They could hardly have fared worse. At their backs rose a perpendicular\\r\\nwall of rock, and Perrault and François were compelled to make their fire and\\r\\nspread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake itself. The tent they had\\r\\ndiscarded at Dyea in order to travel light. A few sticks of driftwood furnished\\r\\nthem with a fire that thawed down through the ice and left them to eat supper\\r\\nin the dark.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nClose in under the sheltering rock Buck made his nest. So snug and warm was it,\\r\\nthat he was loath to leave it when François distributed the fish which he had\\r\\nfirst thawed over the fire. But when Buck finished his ration and returned, he\\r\\nfound his nest occupied. A warning snarl told him that the trespasser was\\r\\nSpitz. Till now Buck had avoided trouble with his enemy, but this was too much.\\r\\nThe beast in him roared. He sprang upon Spitz with a fury which surprised them\\r\\nboth, and Spitz particularly, for his whole experience with Buck had gone to\\r\\nteach him that his rival was an unusually timid dog, who managed to hold his\\r\\nown only because of his great weight and size.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFrançois was surprised, too, when they shot out in a tangle from the disrupted\\r\\nnest and he divined the cause of the trouble. “A-a-ah!” he cried to\\r\\nBuck. “Gif it to heem, by Gar! Gif it to heem, the dirty\\r\\nt’eef!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSpitz was equally willing. He was crying with sheer rage and eagerness as he\\r\\ncircled back and forth for a chance to spring in. Buck was no less eager, and\\r\\nno less cautious, as he likewise circled back and forth for the advantage. But\\r\\nit was then that the unexpected happened, the thing which projected their\\r\\nstruggle for supremacy far into the future, past many a weary mile of trail and\\r\\ntoil.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAn oath from Perrault, the resounding impact of a club upon a bony frame, and a\\r\\nshrill yelp of pain, heralded the breaking forth of pandemonium. The camp was\\r\\nsuddenly discovered to be alive with skulking furry forms,—starving\\r\\nhuskies, four or five score of them, who had scented the camp from some Indian\\r\\nvillage. They had crept in while Buck and Spitz were fighting, and when the two\\r\\nmen sprang among them with stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back.\\r\\nThey were crazed by the smell of the food. Perrault found one with head buried\\r\\nin the grub-box. His club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs, and the grub-box\\r\\nwas capsized on the ground. On the instant a score of the famished brutes were\\r\\nscrambling for the bread and bacon. The clubs fell upon them unheeded. They\\r\\nyelped and howled under the rain of blows, but struggled none the less madly\\r\\ntill the last crumb had been devoured.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime the astonished team-dogs had burst out of their nests only to\\r\\nbe set upon by the fierce invaders. Never had Buck seen such dogs. It seemed as\\r\\nthough their bones would burst through their skins. They were mere skeletons,\\r\\ndraped loosely in draggled hides, with blazing eyes and slavered fangs. But the\\r\\nhunger-madness made them terrifying, irresistible. There was no opposing them.\\r\\nThe team-dogs were swept back against the cliff at the first onset. Buck was\\r\\nbeset by three huskies, and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and\\r\\nslashed. The din was frightful. Billee was crying as usual. Dave and Sol-leks,\\r\\ndripping blood from a score of wounds, were fighting bravely side by side. Joe\\r\\nwas snapping like a demon. Once, his teeth closed on the fore leg of a husky,\\r\\nand he crunched down through the bone. Pike, the malingerer, leaped upon the\\r\\ncrippled animal, breaking its neck with a quick flash of teeth and a jerk, Buck\\r\\ngot a frothing adversary by the throat, and was sprayed with blood when his\\r\\nteeth sank through the jugular. The warm taste of it in his mouth goaded him to\\r\\ngreater fierceness. He flung himself upon another, and at the same time felt\\r\\nteeth sink into his own throat. It was Spitz, treacherously attacking from the\\r\\nside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPerrault and François, having cleaned out their part of the camp, hurried to\\r\\nsave their sled-dogs. The wild wave of famished beasts rolled back before them,\\r\\nand Buck shook himself free. But it was only for a moment. The two men were\\r\\ncompelled to run back to save the grub, upon which the huskies returned to the\\r\\nattack on the team. Billee, terrified into bravery, sprang through the savage\\r\\ncircle and fled away over the ice. Pike and Dub followed on his heels, with the\\r\\nrest of the team behind. As Buck drew himself together to spring after them,\\r\\nout of the tail of his eye he saw Spitz rush upon him with the evident\\r\\nintention of overthrowing him. Once off his feet and under that mass of\\r\\nhuskies, there was no hope for him. But he braced himself to the shock of\\r\\nSpitz’s charge, then joined the flight out on the lake.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLater, the nine team-dogs gathered together and sought shelter in the forest.\\r\\nThough unpursued, they were in a sorry plight. There was not one who was not\\r\\nwounded in four or five places, while some were wounded grievously. Dub was\\r\\nbadly injured in a hind leg; Dolly, the last husky added to the team at Dyea,\\r\\nhad a badly torn throat; Joe had lost an eye; while Billee, the good-natured,\\r\\nwith an ear chewed and rent to ribbons, cried and whimpered throughout the\\r\\nnight. At daybreak they limped warily back to camp, to find the marauders gone\\r\\nand the two men in bad tempers. Fully half their grub supply was gone. The\\r\\nhuskies had chewed through the sled lashings and canvas coverings. In fact,\\r\\nnothing, no matter how remotely eatable, had escaped them. They had eaten a\\r\\npair of Perrault’s moose-hide moccasins, chunks out of the leather\\r\\ntraces, and even two feet of lash from the end of François’s whip. He\\r\\nbroke from a mournful contemplation of it to look over his wounded dogs.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah, my frien’s,” he said softly, “mebbe it mek you mad\\r\\ndog, dose many bites. Mebbe all mad dog, sacredam! Wot you t’ink, eh,\\r\\nPerrault?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe courier shook his head dubiously. With four hundred miles of trail still\\r\\nbetween him and Dawson, he could ill afford to have madness break out among his\\r\\ndogs. Two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses into shape, and the\\r\\nwound-stiffened team was under way, struggling painfully over the hardest part\\r\\nof the trail they had yet encountered, and for that matter, the hardest between\\r\\nthem and Dawson.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Thirty Mile River was wide open. Its wild water defied the frost, and it\\r\\nwas in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held at all. Six\\r\\ndays of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty terrible miles. And\\r\\nterrible they were, for every foot of them was accomplished at the risk of life\\r\\nto dog and man. A dozen times, Perrault, nosing the way broke through the ice\\r\\nbridges, being saved by the long pole he carried, which he so held that it fell\\r\\neach time across the hole made by his body. But a cold snap was on, the\\r\\nthermometer registering fifty below zero, and each time he broke through he was\\r\\ncompelled for very life to build a fire and dry his garments.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNothing daunted him. It was because nothing daunted him that he had been chosen\\r\\nfor government courier. He took all manner of risks, resolutely thrusting his\\r\\nlittle weazened face into the frost and struggling on from dim dawn to dark. He\\r\\nskirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent and crackled under foot and\\r\\nupon which they dared not halt. Once, the sled broke through, with Dave and\\r\\nBuck, and they were half-frozen and all but drowned by the time they were\\r\\ndragged out. The usual fire was necessary to save them. They were coated\\r\\nsolidly with ice, and the two men kept them on the run around the fire,\\r\\nsweating and thawing, so close that they were singed by the flames.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt another time Spitz went through, dragging the whole team after him up to\\r\\nBuck, who strained backward with all his strength, his fore paws on the\\r\\nslippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around. But behind him was\\r\\nDave, likewise straining backward, and behind the sled was François, pulling\\r\\ntill his tendons cracked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAgain, the rim ice broke away before and behind, and there was no escape except\\r\\nup the cliff. Perrault scaled it by a miracle, while François prayed for just\\r\\nthat miracle; and with every thong and sled lashing and the last bit of harness\\r\\nrove into a long rope, the dogs were hoisted, one by one, to the cliff crest.\\r\\nFrançois came up last, after the sled and load. Then came the search for a\\r\\nplace to descend, which descent was ultimately made by the aid of the rope, and\\r\\nnight found them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the day’s\\r\\ncredit.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBy the time they made the Hootalinqua and good ice, Buck was played out. The\\r\\nrest of the dogs were in like condition; but Perrault, to make up lost time,\\r\\npushed them late and early. The first day they covered thirty-five miles to the\\r\\nBig Salmon; the next day thirty-five more to the Little Salmon; the third day\\r\\nforty miles, which brought them well up toward the Five Fingers.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck’s feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies. His\\r\\nhad softened during the many generations since the day his last wild ancestor\\r\\nwas tamed by a cave-dweller or river man. All day long he limped in agony, and\\r\\ncamp once made, lay down like a dead dog. Hungry as he was, he would not move\\r\\nto receive his ration of fish, which François had to bring to him. Also, the\\r\\ndog-driver rubbed Buck’s feet for half an hour each night after supper,\\r\\nand sacrificed the tops of his own moccasins to make four moccasins for Buck.\\r\\nThis was a great relief, and Buck caused even the weazened face of Perrault to\\r\\ntwist itself into a grin one morning, when François forgot the moccasins and\\r\\nBuck lay on his back, his four feet waving appealingly in the air, and refused\\r\\nto budge without them. Later his feet grew hard to the trail, and the worn-out\\r\\nfoot-gear was thrown away.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt the Pelly one morning, as they were harnessing up, Dolly, who had never been\\r\\nconspicuous for anything, went suddenly mad. She announced her condition by a\\r\\nlong, heartbreaking wolf howl that sent every dog bristling with fear, then\\r\\nsprang straight for Buck. He had never seen a dog go mad, nor did he have any\\r\\nreason to fear madness; yet he knew that here was horror, and fled away from it\\r\\nin a panic. Straight away he raced, with Dolly, panting and frothing, one leap\\r\\nbehind; nor could she gain on him, so great was his terror, nor could he leave\\r\\nher, so great was her madness. He plunged through the wooded breast of the\\r\\nisland, flew down to the lower end, crossed a back channel filled with rough\\r\\nice to another island, gained a third island, curved back to the main river,\\r\\nand in desperation started to cross it. And all the time, though he did not\\r\\nlook, he could hear her snarling just one leap behind. François called to him a\\r\\nquarter of a mile away and he doubled back, still one leap ahead, gasping\\r\\npainfully for air and putting all his faith in that François would save him.\\r\\nThe dog-driver held the axe poised in his hand, and as Buck shot past him the\\r\\naxe crashed down upon mad Dolly’s head.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck staggered over against the sled, exhausted, sobbing for breath, helpless.\\r\\nThis was Spitz’s opportunity. He sprang upon Buck, and twice his teeth\\r\\nsank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to the bone. Then\\r\\nFrançois’s lash descended, and Buck had the satisfaction of watching\\r\\nSpitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any of the teams.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One devil, dat Spitz,” remarked Perrault. “Some dam day heem\\r\\nkeel dat Buck.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Dat Buck two devils,” was François’s rejoinder. “All\\r\\nde tam I watch dat Buck I know for sure. Lissen: some dam fine day heem get mad\\r\\nlak hell an’ den heem chew dat Spitz all up an’ spit heem out on de\\r\\nsnow. Sure. I know.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFrom then on it was war between them. Spitz, as lead-dog and acknowledged\\r\\nmaster of the team, felt his supremacy threatened by this strange Southland\\r\\ndog. And strange Buck was to him, for of the many Southland dogs he had known,\\r\\nnot one had shown up worthily in camp and on trail. They were all too soft,\\r\\ndying under the toil, the frost, and starvation. Buck was the exception. He\\r\\nalone endured and prospered, matching the husky in strength, savagery, and\\r\\ncunning. Then he was a masterful dog, and what made him dangerous was the fact\\r\\nthat the club of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and\\r\\nrashness out of his desire for mastery. He was preeminently cunning, and could\\r\\nbide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come. Buck wanted it. He\\r\\nwanted it because it was his nature, because he had been gripped tight by that\\r\\nnameless, incomprehensible pride of the trail and trace—that pride which\\r\\nholds dogs in the toil to the last gasp, which lures them to die joyfully in\\r\\nthe harness, and breaks their hearts if they are cut out of the harness. This\\r\\nwas the pride of Dave as wheel-dog, of Sol-leks as he pulled with all his\\r\\nstrength; the pride that laid hold of them at break of camp, transforming them\\r\\nfrom sour and sullen brutes into straining, eager, ambitious creatures; the\\r\\npride that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night,\\r\\nletting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent. This was the pride\\r\\nthat bore up Spitz and made him thrash the sled-dogs who blundered and shirked\\r\\nin the traces or hid away at harness-up time in the morning. Likewise it was\\r\\nthis pride that made him fear Buck as a possible lead-dog. And this was\\r\\nBuck’s pride, too.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe openly threatened the other’s leadership. He came between him and the\\r\\nshirks he should have punished. And he did it deliberately. One night there was\\r\\na heavy snowfall, and in the morning Pike, the malingerer, did not appear. He\\r\\nwas securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow. François called him and\\r\\nsought him in vain. Spitz was wild with wrath. He raged through the camp,\\r\\nsmelling and digging in every likely place, snarling so frightfully that Pike\\r\\nheard and shivered in his hiding-place.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut when he was at last unearthed, and Spitz flew at him to punish him, Buck\\r\\nflew, with equal rage, in between. So unexpected was it, and so shrewdly\\r\\nmanaged, that Spitz was hurled backward and off his feet. Pike, who had been\\r\\ntrembling abjectly, took heart at this open mutiny, and sprang upon his\\r\\noverthrown leader. Buck, to whom fair play was a forgotten code, likewise\\r\\nsprang upon Spitz. But François, chuckling at the incident while unswerving in\\r\\nthe administration of justice, brought his lash down upon Buck with all his\\r\\nmight. This failed to drive Buck from his prostrate rival, and the butt of the\\r\\nwhip was brought into play. Half-stunned by the blow, Buck was knocked backward\\r\\nand the lash laid upon him again and again, while Spitz soundly punished the\\r\\nmany times offending Pike.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the days that followed, as Dawson grew closer and closer, Buck still\\r\\ncontinued to interfere between Spitz and the culprits; but he did it craftily,\\r\\nwhen François was not around, With the covert mutiny of Buck, a general\\r\\ninsubordination sprang up and increased. Dave and Sol-leks were unaffected, but\\r\\nthe rest of the team went from bad to worse. Things no longer went right. There\\r\\nwas continual bickering and jangling. Trouble was always afoot, and at the\\r\\nbottom of it was Buck. He kept François busy, for the dog-driver was in\\r\\nconstant apprehension of the life-and-death struggle between the two which he\\r\\nknew must take place sooner or later; and on more than one night the sounds of\\r\\nquarrelling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping\\r\\nrobe, fearful that Buck and Spitz were at it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the opportunity did not present itself, and they pulled into Dawson one\\r\\ndreary afternoon with the great fight still to come. Here were many men, and\\r\\ncountless dogs, and Buck found them all at work. It seemed the ordained order\\r\\nof things that dogs should work. All day they swung up and down the main street\\r\\nin long teams, and in the night their jingling bells still went by. They hauled\\r\\ncabin logs and firewood, freighted up to the mines, and did all manner of work\\r\\nthat horses did in the Santa Clara Valley. Here and there Buck met Southland\\r\\ndogs, but in the main they were the wild wolf husky breed. Every night,\\r\\nregularly, at nine, at twelve, at three, they lifted a nocturnal song, a weird\\r\\nand eerie chant, in which it was Buck’s delight to join.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead, or the stars leaping in the\\r\\nfrost dance, and the land numb and frozen under its pall of snow, this song of\\r\\nthe huskies might have been the defiance of life, only it was pitched in minor\\r\\nkey, with long-drawn wailings and half-sobs, and was more the pleading of life,\\r\\nthe articulate travail of existence. It was an old song, old as the breed\\r\\nitself—one of the first songs of the younger world in a day when songs\\r\\nwere sad. It was invested with the woe of unnumbered generations, this plaint\\r\\nby which Buck was so strangely stirred. When he moaned and sobbed, it was with\\r\\nthe pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers, and the fear\\r\\nand mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery. And that he\\r\\nshould be stirred by it marked the completeness with which he harked back\\r\\nthrough the ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the howling\\r\\nages.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSeven days from the time they pulled into Dawson, they dropped down the steep\\r\\nbank by the Barracks to the Yukon Trail, and pulled for Dyea and Salt Water.\\r\\nPerrault was carrying despatches if anything more urgent than those he had\\r\\nbrought in; also, the travel pride had gripped him, and he purposed to make the\\r\\nrecord trip of the year. Several things favored him in this. The week’s\\r\\nrest had recuperated the dogs and put them in thorough trim. The trail they had\\r\\nbroken into the country was packed hard by later journeyers. And further, the\\r\\npolice had arranged in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man,\\r\\nand he was travelling light.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey made Sixty Mile, which is a fifty-mile run, on the first day; and the\\r\\nsecond day saw them booming up the Yukon well on their way to Pelly. But such\\r\\nsplendid running was achieved not without great trouble and vexation on the\\r\\npart of François. The insidious revolt led by Buck had destroyed the solidarity\\r\\nof the team. It no longer was as one dog leaping in the traces. The\\r\\nencouragement Buck gave the rebels led them into all kinds of petty\\r\\nmisdemeanors. No more was Spitz a leader greatly to be feared. The old awe\\r\\ndeparted, and they grew equal to challenging his authority. Pike robbed him of\\r\\nhalf a fish one night, and gulped it down under the protection of Buck. Another\\r\\nnight Dub and Joe fought Spitz and made him forego the punishment they\\r\\ndeserved. And even Billee, the good-natured, was less good-natured, and whined\\r\\nnot half so placatingly as in former days. Buck never came near Spitz without\\r\\nsnarling and bristling menacingly. In fact, his conduct approached that of a\\r\\nbully, and he was given to swaggering up and down before Spitz’s very\\r\\nnose.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their relations\\r\\nwith one another. They quarrelled and bickered more than ever among themselves,\\r\\ntill at times the camp was a howling bedlam. Dave and Sol-leks alone were\\r\\nunaltered, though they were made irritable by the unending squabbling. François\\r\\nswore strange barbarous oaths, and stamped the snow in futile rage, and tore\\r\\nhis hair. His lash was always singing among the dogs, but it was of small\\r\\navail. Directly his back was turned they were at it again. He backed up Spitz\\r\\nwith his whip, while Buck backed up the remainder of the team. François knew he\\r\\nwas behind all the trouble, and Buck knew he knew; but Buck was too clever ever\\r\\nagain to be caught red-handed. He worked faithfully in the harness, for the\\r\\ntoil had become a delight to him; yet it was a greater delight slyly to\\r\\nprecipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the traces.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt the mouth of the Tahkeena, one night after supper, Dub turned up a snowshoe\\r\\nrabbit, blundered it, and missed. In a second the whole team was in full cry. A\\r\\nhundred yards away was a camp of the Northwest Police, with fifty dogs, huskies\\r\\nall, who joined the chase. The rabbit sped down the river, turned off into a\\r\\nsmall creek, up the frozen bed of which it held steadily. It ran lightly on the\\r\\nsurface of the snow, while the dogs ploughed through by main strength. Buck led\\r\\nthe pack, sixty strong, around bend after bend, but he could not gain. He lay\\r\\ndown low to the race, whining eagerly, his splendid body flashing forward, leap\\r\\nby leap, in the wan white moonlight. And leap by leap, like some pale frost\\r\\nwraith, the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAll that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men out from\\r\\nthe sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things by chemically propelled\\r\\nleaden pellets, the blood lust, the joy to kill—all this was\\r\\nBuck’s, only it was infinitely more intimate. He was ranging at the head\\r\\nof the pack, running the wild thing down, the living meat, to kill with his own\\r\\nteeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm blood.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which life cannot\\r\\nrise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes when one is most\\r\\nalive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive. This\\r\\necstasy, this forgetfulness of living, comes to the artist, caught up and out\\r\\nof himself in a sheet of flame; it comes to the soldier, war-mad on a stricken\\r\\nfield and refusing quarter; and it came to Buck, leading the pack, sounding the\\r\\nold wolf-cry, straining after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly\\r\\nbefore him through the moonlight. He was sounding the deeps of his nature, and\\r\\nof the parts of his nature that were deeper than he, going back into the womb\\r\\nof Time. He was mastered by the sheer surging of life, the tidal wave of being,\\r\\nthe perfect joy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew in that it was\\r\\neverything that was not death, that it was aglow and rampant, expressing itself\\r\\nin movement, flying exultantly under the stars and over the face of dead matter\\r\\nthat did not move.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Spitz, cold and calculating even in his supreme moods, left the pack and\\r\\ncut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend around. Buck\\r\\ndid not know of this, and as he rounded the bend, the frost wraith of a rabbit\\r\\nstill flitting before him, he saw another and larger frost wraith leap from the\\r\\noverhanging bank into the immediate path of the rabbit. It was Spitz. The\\r\\nrabbit could not turn, and as the white teeth broke its back in mid air it\\r\\nshrieked as loudly as a stricken man may shriek. At sound of this, the cry of\\r\\nLife plunging down from Life’s apex in the grip of Death, the fall pack\\r\\nat Buck’s heels raised a hell’s chorus of delight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck did not cry out. He did not check himself, but drove in upon Spitz,\\r\\nshoulder to shoulder, so hard that he missed the throat. They rolled over and\\r\\nover in the powdery snow. Spitz gained his feet almost as though he had not\\r\\nbeen overthrown, slashing Buck down the shoulder and leaping clear. Twice his\\r\\nteeth clipped together, like the steel jaws of a trap, as he backed away for\\r\\nbetter footing, with lean and lifting lips that writhed and snarled.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn a flash Buck knew it. The time had come. It was to the death. As they\\r\\ncircled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the advantage, the\\r\\nscene came to Buck with a sense of familiarity. He seemed to remember it\\r\\nall,—the white woods, and earth, and moonlight, and the thrill of battle.\\r\\nOver the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm. There was not the\\r\\nfaintest whisper of air—nothing moved, not a leaf quivered, the visible\\r\\nbreaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in the frosty air. They had\\r\\nmade short work of the snowshoe rabbit, these dogs that were ill-tamed wolves;\\r\\nand they were now drawn up in an expectant circle. They, too, were silent,\\r\\ntheir eyes only gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward. To Buck it\\r\\nwas nothing new or strange, this scene of old time. It was as though it had\\r\\nalways been, the wonted way of things.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSpitz was a practised fighter. From Spitzbergen through the Arctic, and across\\r\\nCanada and the Barrens, he had held his own with all manner of dogs and\\r\\nachieved to mastery over them. Bitter rage was his, but never blind rage. In\\r\\npassion to rend and destroy, he never forgot that his enemy was in like passion\\r\\nto rend and destroy. He never rushed till he was prepared to receive a rush;\\r\\nnever attacked till he had first defended that attack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn vain Buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog.\\r\\nWherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh, they were countered by the\\r\\nfangs of Spitz. Fang clashed fang, and lips were cut and bleeding, but Buck\\r\\ncould not penetrate his enemy’s guard. Then he warmed up and enveloped\\r\\nSpitz in a whirlwind of rushes. Time and time again he tried for the snow-white\\r\\nthroat, where life bubbled near to the surface, and each time and every time\\r\\nSpitz slashed him and got away. Then Buck took to rushing, as though for the\\r\\nthroat, when, suddenly drawing back his head and curving in from the side, he\\r\\nwould drive his shoulder at the shoulder of Spitz, as a ram by which to\\r\\noverthrow him. But instead, Buck’s shoulder was slashed down each time as\\r\\nSpitz leaped lightly away.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSpitz was untouched, while Buck was streaming with blood and panting hard. The\\r\\nfight was growing desperate. And all the while the silent and wolfish circle\\r\\nwaited to finish off whichever dog went down. As Buck grew winded, Spitz took\\r\\nto rushing, and he kept him staggering for footing. Once Buck went over, and\\r\\nthe whole circle of sixty dogs started up; but he recovered himself, almost in\\r\\nmid air, and the circle sank down again and waited.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Buck possessed a quality that made for greatness—imagination. He\\r\\nfought by instinct, but he could fight by head as well. He rushed, as though\\r\\nattempting the old shoulder trick, but at the last instant swept low to the\\r\\nsnow and in. His teeth closed on Spitz’s left fore leg. There was a\\r\\ncrunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on three legs. Thrice he\\r\\ntried to knock him over, then repeated the trick and broke the right fore leg.\\r\\nDespite the pain and helplessness, Spitz struggled madly to keep up. He saw the\\r\\nsilent circle, with gleaming eyes, lolling tongues, and silvery breaths\\r\\ndrifting upward, closing in upon him as he had seen similar circles close in\\r\\nupon beaten antagonists in the past. Only this time he was the one who was\\r\\nbeaten.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere was no hope for him. Buck was inexorable. Mercy was a thing reserved for\\r\\ngentler climes. He manœuvred for the final rush. The circle had tightened till\\r\\nhe could feel the breaths of the huskies on his flanks. He could see them,\\r\\nbeyond Spitz and to either side, half crouching for the spring, their eyes\\r\\nfixed upon him. A pause seemed to fall. Every animal was motionless as though\\r\\nturned to stone. Only Spitz quivered and bristled as he staggered back and\\r\\nforth, snarling with horrible menace, as though to frighten off impending\\r\\ndeath. Then Buck sprang in and out; but while he was in, shoulder had at last\\r\\nsquarely met shoulder. The dark circle became a dot on the moon-flooded snow as\\r\\nSpitz disappeared from view. Buck stood and looked on, the successful champion,\\r\\nthe dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and found it good.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter IV.',\n"," 'Who Has Won to Mastership\\n\\r\\n“Eh? Wot I say? I spik true w’en I say dat Buck two devils.”\\r\\nThis was François’s speech next morning when he discovered Spitz missing\\r\\nand Buck covered with wounds. He drew him to the fire and by its light pointed\\r\\nthem out.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Dat Spitz fight lak hell,” said Perrault, as he surveyed the\\r\\ngaping rips and cuts.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“An’ dat Buck fight lak two hells,” was François’s\\r\\nanswer. “An’ now we make good time. No more Spitz, no more trouble,\\r\\nsure.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile Perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled, the dog-driver\\r\\nproceeded to harness the dogs. Buck trotted up to the place Spitz would have\\r\\noccupied as leader; but François, not noticing him, brought Sol-leks to the\\r\\ncoveted position. In his judgment, Sol-leks was the best lead-dog left. Buck\\r\\nsprang upon Sol-leks in a fury, driving him back and standing in his place.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Eh? eh?” François cried, slapping his thighs gleefully.\\r\\n“Look at dat Buck. Heem keel dat Spitz, heem t’ink to take de\\r\\njob.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Go ’way, Chook!” he cried, but Buck refused to budge.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe took Buck by the scruff of the neck, and though the dog growled\\r\\nthreateningly, dragged him to one side and replaced Sol-leks. The old dog did\\r\\nnot like it, and showed plainly that he was afraid of Buck. François was\\r\\nobdurate, but when he turned his back Buck again displaced Sol-leks, who was\\r\\nnot at all unwilling to go.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFrançois was angry. “Now, by Gar, I feex you!” he cried, coming\\r\\nback with a heavy club in his hand.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck remembered the man in the red sweater, and retreated slowly; nor did he\\r\\nattempt to charge in when Sol-leks was once more brought forward. But he\\r\\ncircled just beyond the range of the club, snarling with bitterness and rage;\\r\\nand while he circled he watched the club so as to dodge it if thrown by\\r\\nFrançois, for he was become wise in the way of clubs. The driver went about his\\r\\nwork, and he called to Buck when he was ready to put him in his old place in\\r\\nfront of Dave. Buck retreated two or three steps. François followed him up,\\r\\nwhereupon he again retreated. After some time of this, François threw down the\\r\\nclub, thinking that Buck feared a thrashing. But Buck was in open revolt. He\\r\\nwanted, not to escape a clubbing, but to have the leadership. It was his by\\r\\nright. He had earned it, and he would not be content with less.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPerrault took a hand. Between them they ran him about for the better part of an\\r\\nhour. They threw clubs at him. He dodged. They cursed him, and his fathers and\\r\\nmothers before him, and all his seed to come after him down to the remotest\\r\\ngeneration, and every hair on his body and drop of blood in his veins; and he\\r\\nanswered curse with snarl and kept out of their reach. He did not try to run\\r\\naway, but retreated around and around the camp, advertising plainly that when\\r\\nhis desire was met, he would come in and be good.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFrançois sat down and scratched his head. Perrault looked at his watch and\\r\\nswore. Time was flying, and they should have been on the trail an hour gone.\\r\\nFrançois scratched his head again. He shook it and grinned sheepishly at the\\r\\ncourier, who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they were beaten. Then\\r\\nFrançois went up to where Sol-leks stood and called to Buck. Buck laughed, as\\r\\ndogs laugh, yet kept his distance. François unfastened Sol-leks’s traces\\r\\nand put him back in his old place. The team stood harnessed to the sled in an\\r\\nunbroken line, ready for the trail. There was no place for Buck save at the\\r\\nfront. Once more François called, and once more Buck laughed and kept away.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“T’row down de club,” Perrault commanded.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFrançois complied, whereupon Buck trotted in, laughing triumphantly, and swung\\r\\naround into position at the head of the team. His traces were fastened, the\\r\\nsled broken out, and with both men running they dashed out on to the river\\r\\ntrail.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHighly as the dog-driver had forevalued Buck, with his two devils, he found,\\r\\nwhile the day was yet young, that he had undervalued. At a bound Buck took up\\r\\nthe duties of leadership; and where judgment was required, and quick thinking\\r\\nand quick acting, he showed himself the superior even of Spitz, of whom\\r\\nFrançois had never seen an equal.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it, that Buck\\r\\nexcelled. Dave and Sol-leks did not mind the change in leadership. It was none\\r\\nof their business. Their business was to toil, and toil mightily, in the\\r\\ntraces. So long as that were not interfered with, they did not care what\\r\\nhappened. Billee, the good-natured, could lead for all they cared, so long as\\r\\nhe kept order. The rest of the team, however, had grown unruly during the last\\r\\ndays of Spitz, and their surprise was great now that Buck proceeded to lick\\r\\nthem into shape.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPike, who pulled at Buck’s heels, and who never put an ounce more of his\\r\\nweight against the breast-band than he was compelled to do, was swiftly and\\r\\nrepeatedly shaken for loafing; and ere the first day was done he was pulling\\r\\nmore than ever before in his life. The first night in camp, Joe, the sour one,\\r\\nwas punished roundly—a thing that Spitz had never succeeded in doing.\\r\\nBuck simply smothered him by virtue of superior weight, and cut him up till he\\r\\nceased snapping and began to whine for mercy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe general tone of the team picked up immediately. It recovered its old-time\\r\\nsolidarity, and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the traces. At the Rink\\r\\nRapids two native huskies, Teek and Koona, were added; and the celerity with\\r\\nwhich Buck broke them in took away François’s breath.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nevaire such a dog as dat Buck!” he cried. “No, nevaire!\\r\\nHeem worth one t’ousan’ dollair, by Gar! Eh? Wot you say,\\r\\nPerrault?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Perrault nodded. He was ahead of the record then, and gaining day by day.\\r\\nThe trail was in excellent condition, well packed and hard, and there was no\\r\\nnew-fallen snow with which to contend. It was not too cold. The temperature\\r\\ndropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip. The men rode and\\r\\nran by turn, and the dogs were kept on the jump, with but infrequent stoppages.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Thirty Mile River was comparatively coated with ice, and they covered in\\r\\none day going out what had taken them ten days coming in. In one run they made\\r\\na sixty-mile dash from the foot of Lake Le Barge to the White Horse Rapids.\\r\\nAcross Marsh, Tagish, and Bennett (seventy miles of lakes), they flew so fast\\r\\nthat the man whose turn it was to run towed behind the sled at the end of a\\r\\nrope. And on the last night of the second week they topped White Pass and\\r\\ndropped down the sea slope with the lights of Skaguay and of the shipping at\\r\\ntheir feet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was a record run. Each day for fourteen days they had averaged forty miles.\\r\\nFor three days Perrault and François threw chests up and down the main street\\r\\nof Skaguay and were deluged with invitations to drink, while the team was the\\r\\nconstant centre of a worshipful crowd of dog-busters and mushers. Then three or\\r\\nfour western bad men aspired to clean out the town, were riddled like\\r\\npepper-boxes for their pains, and public interest turned to other idols. Next\\r\\ncame official orders. François called Buck to him, threw his arms around him,\\r\\nwept over him. And that was the last of François and Perrault. Like other men,\\r\\nthey passed out of Buck’s life for good.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA Scotch half-breed took charge of him and his mates, and in company with a\\r\\ndozen other dog-teams he started back over the weary trail to Dawson. It was no\\r\\nlight running now, nor record time, but heavy toil each day, with a heavy load\\r\\nbehind; for this was the mail train, carrying word from the world to the men\\r\\nwho sought gold under the shadow of the Pole.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck did not like it, but he bore up well to the work, taking pride in it after\\r\\nthe manner of Dave and Sol-leks, and seeing that his mates, whether they prided\\r\\nin it or not, did their fair share. It was a monotonous life, operating with\\r\\nmachine-like regularity. One day was very like another. At a certain time each\\r\\nmorning the cooks turned out, fires were built, and breakfast was eaten. Then,\\r\\nwhile some broke camp, others harnessed the dogs, and they were under way an\\r\\nhour or so before the darkness fell which gave warning of dawn. At night, camp\\r\\nwas made. Some pitched the flies, others cut firewood and pine boughs for the\\r\\nbeds, and still others carried water or ice for the cooks. Also, the dogs were\\r\\nfed. To them, this was the one feature of the day, though it was good to loaf\\r\\naround, after the fish was eaten, for an hour or so with the other dogs, of\\r\\nwhich there were fivescore and odd. There were fierce fighters among them, but\\r\\nthree battles with the fiercest brought Buck to mastery, so that when he\\r\\nbristled and showed his teeth they got out of his way.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBest of all, perhaps, he loved to lie near the fire, hind legs crouched under\\r\\nhim, fore legs stretched out in front, head raised, and eyes blinking dreamily\\r\\nat the flames. Sometimes he thought of Judge Miller’s big house in the\\r\\nsun-kissed Santa Clara Valley, and of the cement swimming-tank, and Ysabel, the\\r\\nMexican hairless, and Toots, the Japanese pug; but oftener he remembered the\\r\\nman in the red sweater, the death of Curly, the great fight with Spitz, and the\\r\\ngood things he had eaten or would like to eat. He was not homesick. The Sunland\\r\\nwas very dim and distant, and such memories had no power over him. Far more\\r\\npotent were the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never seen\\r\\nbefore a seeming familiarity; the instincts (which were but the memories of his\\r\\nancestors become habits) which had lapsed in later days, and still later, in\\r\\nhim, quickened and become alive again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSometimes as he crouched there, blinking dreamily at the flames, it seemed that\\r\\nthe flames were of another fire, and that as he crouched by this other fire he\\r\\nsaw another and different man from the half-breed cook before him. This other\\r\\nman was shorter of leg and longer of arm, with muscles that were stringy and\\r\\nknotty rather than rounded and swelling. The hair of this man was long and\\r\\nmatted, and his head slanted back under it from the eyes. He uttered strange\\r\\nsounds, and seemed very much afraid of the darkness, into which he peered\\r\\ncontinually, clutching in his hand, which hung midway between knee and foot, a\\r\\nstick with a heavy stone made fast to the end. He was all but naked, a ragged\\r\\nand fire-scorched skin hanging part way down his back, but on his body there\\r\\nwas much hair. In some places, across the chest and shoulders and down the\\r\\noutside of the arms and thighs, it was matted into almost a thick fur. He did\\r\\nnot stand erect, but with trunk inclined forward from the hips, on legs that\\r\\nbent at the knees. About his body there was a peculiar springiness, or\\r\\nresiliency, almost catlike, and a quick alertness as of one who lived in\\r\\nperpetual fear of things seen and unseen.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt other times this hairy man squatted by the fire with head between his legs\\r\\nand slept. On such occasions his elbows were on his knees, his hands clasped\\r\\nabove his head as though to shed rain by the hairy arms. And beyond that fire,\\r\\nin the circling darkness, Buck could see many gleaming coals, two by two,\\r\\nalways two by two, which he knew to be the eyes of great beasts of prey. And he\\r\\ncould hear the crashing of their bodies through the undergrowth, and the noises\\r\\nthey made in the night. And dreaming there by the Yukon bank, with lazy eyes\\r\\nblinking at the fire, these sounds and sights of another world would make the\\r\\nhair to rise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his\\r\\nneck, till he whimpered low and suppressedly, or growled softly, and the\\r\\nhalf-breed cook shouted at him, “Hey, you Buck, wake up!” Whereupon\\r\\nthe other world would vanish and the real world come into his eyes, and he\\r\\nwould get up and yawn and stretch as though he had been asleep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was a hard trip, with the mail behind them, and the heavy work wore them\\r\\ndown. They were short of weight and in poor condition when they made Dawson,\\r\\nand should have had a ten days’ or a week’s rest at least. But in\\r\\ntwo days’ time they dropped down the Yukon bank from the Barracks, loaded\\r\\nwith letters for the outside. The dogs were tired, the drivers grumbling, and\\r\\nto make matters worse, it snowed every day. This meant a soft trail, greater\\r\\nfriction on the runners, and heavier pulling for the dogs; yet the drivers were\\r\\nfair through it all, and did their best for the animals.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEach night the dogs were attended to first. They ate before the drivers ate,\\r\\nand no man sought his sleeping-robe till he had seen to the feet of the dogs he\\r\\ndrove. Still, their strength went down. Since the beginning of the winter they\\r\\nhad travelled eighteen hundred miles, dragging sleds the whole weary distance;\\r\\nand eighteen hundred miles will tell upon life of the toughest. Buck stood it,\\r\\nkeeping his mates up to their work and maintaining discipline, though he, too,\\r\\nwas very tired. Billee cried and whimpered regularly in his sleep each night.\\r\\nJoe was sourer than ever, and Sol-leks was unapproachable, blind side or other\\r\\nside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut it was Dave who suffered most of all. Something had gone wrong with him. He\\r\\nbecame more morose and irritable, and when camp was pitched at once made his\\r\\nnest, where his driver fed him. Once out of the harness and down, he did not\\r\\nget on his feet again till harness-up time in the morning. Sometimes, in the\\r\\ntraces, when jerked by a sudden stoppage of the sled, or by straining to start\\r\\nit, he would cry out with pain. The driver examined him, but could find\\r\\nnothing. All the drivers became interested in his case. They talked it over at\\r\\nmeal-time, and over their last pipes before going to bed, and one night they\\r\\nheld a consultation. He was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed\\r\\nand prodded till he cried out many times. Something was wrong inside, but they\\r\\ncould locate no broken bones, could not make it out.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBy the time Cassiar Bar was reached, he was so weak that he was falling\\r\\nrepeatedly in the traces. The Scotch half-breed called a halt and took him out\\r\\nof the team, making the next dog, Sol-leks, fast to the sled. His intention was\\r\\nto rest Dave, letting him run free behind the sled. Sick as he was, Dave\\r\\nresented being taken out, grunting and growling while the traces were\\r\\nunfastened, and whimpering broken-heartedly when he saw Sol-leks in the\\r\\nposition he had held and served so long. For the pride of trace and trail was\\r\\nhis, and, sick unto death, he could not bear that another dog should do his\\r\\nwork.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the sled started, he floundered in the soft snow alongside the beaten\\r\\ntrail, attacking Sol-leks with his teeth, rushing against him and trying to\\r\\nthrust him off into the soft snow on the other side, striving to leap inside\\r\\nhis traces and get between him and the sled, and all the while whining and\\r\\nyelping and crying with grief and pain. The half-breed tried to drive him away\\r\\nwith the whip; but he paid no heed to the stinging lash, and the man had not\\r\\nthe heart to strike harder. Dave refused to run quietly on the trail behind the\\r\\nsled, where the going was easy, but continued to flounder alongside in the soft\\r\\nsnow, where the going was most difficult, till exhausted. Then he fell, and lay\\r\\nwhere he fell, howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds churned by.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along behind till\\r\\nthe train made another stop, when he floundered past the sleds to his own,\\r\\nwhere he stood alongside Sol-leks. His driver lingered a moment to get a light\\r\\nfor his pipe from the man behind. Then he returned and started his dogs. They\\r\\nswung out on the trail with remarkable lack of exertion, turned their heads\\r\\nuneasily, and stopped in surprise. The driver was surprised, too; the sled had\\r\\nnot moved. He called his comrades to witness the sight. Dave had bitten through\\r\\nboth of Sol-leks’s traces, and was standing directly in front of the sled\\r\\nin his proper place.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe pleaded with his eyes to remain there. The driver was perplexed. His\\r\\ncomrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being denied the\\r\\nwork that killed it, and recalled instances they had known, where dogs, too old\\r\\nfor the toil, or injured, had died because they were cut out of the traces.\\r\\nAlso, they held it a mercy, since Dave was to die anyway, that he should die in\\r\\nthe traces, heart-easy and content. So he was harnessed in again, and proudly\\r\\nhe pulled as of old, though more than once he cried out involuntarily from the\\r\\nbite of his inward hurt. Several times he fell down and was dragged in the\\r\\ntraces, and once the sled ran upon him so that he limped thereafter in one of\\r\\nhis hind legs.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut he held out till camp was reached, when his driver made a place for him by\\r\\nthe fire. Morning found him too weak to travel. At harness-up time he tried to\\r\\ncrawl to his driver. By convulsive efforts he got on his feet, staggered, and\\r\\nfell. Then he wormed his way forward slowly toward where the harnesses were\\r\\nbeing put on his mates. He would advance his fore legs and drag up his body\\r\\nwith a sort of hitching movement, when he would advance his fore legs and hitch\\r\\nahead again for a few more inches. His strength left him, and the last his\\r\\nmates saw of him he lay gasping in the snow and yearning toward them. But they\\r\\ncould hear him mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt\\r\\nof river timber.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHere the train was halted. The Scotch half-breed slowly retraced his steps to\\r\\nthe camp they had left. The men ceased talking. A revolver-shot rang out. The\\r\\nman came back hurriedly. The whips snapped, the bells tinkled merrily, the\\r\\nsleds churned along the trail; but Buck knew, and every dog knew, what had\\r\\ntaken place behind the belt of river trees.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter V.',\n"," 'The Toil of Trace and Trail\\n\\r\\nThirty days from the time it left Dawson, the Salt Water Mail, with Buck and\\r\\nhis mates at the fore, arrived at Skaguay. They were in a wretched state, worn\\r\\nout and worn down. Buck’s one hundred and forty pounds had dwindled to\\r\\none hundred and fifteen. The rest of his mates, though lighter dogs, had\\r\\nrelatively lost more weight than he. Pike, the malingerer, who, in his lifetime\\r\\nof deceit, had often successfully feigned a hurt leg, was now limping in\\r\\nearnest. Sol-leks was limping, and Dub was suffering from a wrenched\\r\\nshoulder-blade.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey were all terribly footsore. No spring or rebound was left in them. Their\\r\\nfeet fell heavily on the trail, jarring their bodies and doubling the fatigue\\r\\nof a day’s travel. There was nothing the matter with them except that\\r\\nthey were dead tired. It was not the dead-tiredness that comes through brief\\r\\nand excessive effort, from which recovery is a matter of hours; but it was the\\r\\ndead-tiredness that comes through the slow and prolonged strength drainage of\\r\\nmonths of toil. There was no power of recuperation left, no reserve strength to\\r\\ncall upon. It had been all used, the last least bit of it. Every muscle, every\\r\\nfibre, every cell, was tired, dead tired. And there was reason for it. In less\\r\\nthan five months they had travelled twenty-five hundred miles, during the last\\r\\neighteen hundred of which they had had but five days’ rest. When they\\r\\narrived at Skaguay they were apparently on their last legs. They could barely\\r\\nkeep the traces taut, and on the down grades just managed to keep out of the\\r\\nway of the sled.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mush on, poor sore feets,” the driver encouraged them as they\\r\\ntottered down the main street of Skaguay. “Dis is de las’. Den we\\r\\nget one long res’. Eh? For sure. One bully long res’.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe drivers confidently expected a long stopover. Themselves, they had covered\\r\\ntwelve hundred miles with two days’ rest, and in the nature of reason and\\r\\ncommon justice they deserved an interval of loafing. But so many were the men\\r\\nwho had rushed into the Klondike, and so many were the sweethearts, wives, and\\r\\nkin that had not rushed in, that the congested mail was taking on Alpine\\r\\nproportions; also, there were official orders. Fresh batches of Hudson Bay dogs\\r\\nwere to take the places of those worthless for the trail. The worthless ones\\r\\nwere to be got rid of, and, since dogs count for little against dollars, they\\r\\nwere to be sold.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThree days passed, by which time Buck and his mates found how really tired and\\r\\nweak they were. Then, on the morning of the fourth day, two men from the States\\r\\ncame along and bought them, harness and all, for a song. The men addressed each\\r\\nother as “Hal” and “Charles.” Charles was a\\r\\nmiddle-aged, lightish-colored man, with weak and watery eyes and a mustache\\r\\nthat twisted fiercely and vigorously up, giving the lie to the limply drooping\\r\\nlip it concealed. Hal was a youngster of nineteen or twenty, with a big\\r\\nColt’s revolver and a hunting-knife strapped about him on a belt that\\r\\nfairly bristled with cartridges. This belt was the most salient thing about\\r\\nhim. It advertised his callowness—a callowness sheer and unutterable.\\r\\nBoth men were manifestly out of place, and why such as they should adventure\\r\\nthe North is part of the mystery of things that passes understanding.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the\\r\\nGovernment agent, and knew that the Scotch half-breed and the mail-train\\r\\ndrivers were passing out of his life on the heels of Perrault and François and\\r\\nthe others who had gone before. When driven with his mates to the new\\r\\nowners’ camp, Buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair, tent half\\r\\nstretched, dishes unwashed, everything in disorder; also, he saw a woman.\\r\\n“Mercedes” the men called her. She was Charles’s wife and\\r\\nHal’s sister—a nice family party.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the tent and\\r\\nload the sled. There was a great deal of effort about their manner, but no\\r\\nbusinesslike method. The tent was rolled into an awkward bundle three times as\\r\\nlarge as it should have been. The tin dishes were packed away unwashed.\\r\\nMercedes continually fluttered in the way of her men and kept up an unbroken\\r\\nchattering of remonstrance and advice. When they put a clothes-sack on the\\r\\nfront of the sled, she suggested it should go on the back; and when they had\\r\\nput it on the back, and covered it over with a couple of other bundles, she\\r\\ndiscovered overlooked articles which could abide nowhere else but in that very\\r\\nsack, and they unloaded again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThree men from a neighboring tent came out and looked on, grinning and winking\\r\\nat one another.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You’ve got a right smart load as it is,” said one of them;\\r\\n“and it’s not me should tell you your business, but I\\r\\nwouldn’t tote that tent along if I was you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Undreamed of!” cried Mercedes, throwing up her hands in dainty\\r\\ndismay. “However in the world could I manage without a tent?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s springtime, and you won’t get any more cold\\r\\nweather,” the man replied.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head decidedly, and Charles and Hal put the last odds and ends on\\r\\ntop the mountainous load.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Think it’ll ride?” one of the men asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why shouldn’t it?” Charles demanded rather shortly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that’s all right, that’s all right,” the man\\r\\nhastened meekly to say. “I was just a-wonderin’, that is all. It\\r\\nseemed a mite top-heavy.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nCharles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he could, which\\r\\nwas not in the least well.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“An’ of course the dogs can hike along all day with that\\r\\ncontraption behind them,” affirmed a second of the men.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Certainly,” said Hal, with freezing politeness, taking hold of the\\r\\ngee-pole with one hand and swinging his whip from the other.\\r\\n“Mush!” he shouted. “Mush on there!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe dogs sprang against the breast-bands, strained hard for a few moments, then\\r\\nrelaxed. They were unable to move the sled.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The lazy brutes, I’ll show them,” he cried, preparing to\\r\\nlash out at them with the whip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Mercedes interfered, crying, “Oh, Hal, you mustn’t,” as\\r\\nshe caught hold of the whip and wrenched it from him. “The poor dears!\\r\\nNow you must promise you won’t be harsh with them for the rest of the\\r\\ntrip, or I won’t go a step.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Precious lot you know about dogs,” her brother sneered; “and\\r\\nI wish you’d leave me alone. They’re lazy, I tell you, and\\r\\nyou’ve got to whip them to get anything out of them. That’s their\\r\\nway. You ask any one. Ask one of those men.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMercedes looked at them imploringly, untold repugnance at sight of pain written\\r\\nin her pretty face.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They’re weak as water, if you want to know,” came the reply\\r\\nfrom one of the men. “Plum tuckered out, that’s what’s the\\r\\nmatter. They need a rest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Rest be blanked,” said Hal, with his beardless lips; and Mercedes\\r\\nsaid, “Oh!” in pain and sorrow at the oath.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut she was a clannish creature, and rushed at once to the defence of her\\r\\nbrother. “Never mind that man,” she said pointedly.\\r\\n“You’re driving our dogs, and you do what you think best with\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAgain Hal’s whip fell upon the dogs. They threw themselves against the\\r\\nbreast-bands, dug their feet into the packed snow, got down low to it, and put\\r\\nforth all their strength. The sled held as though it were an anchor. After two\\r\\nefforts, they stood still, panting. The whip was whistling savagely, when once\\r\\nmore Mercedes interfered. She dropped on her knees before Buck, with tears in\\r\\nher eyes, and put her arms around his neck.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You poor, poor dears,” she cried sympathetically, “why\\r\\ndon’t you pull hard?—then you wouldn’t be whipped.”\\r\\nBuck did not like her, but he was feeling too miserable to resist her, taking\\r\\nit as part of the day’s miserable work.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne of the onlookers, who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot speech,\\r\\nnow spoke up:—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s not that I care a whoop what becomes of you, but for the\\r\\ndogs’ sakes I just want to tell you, you can help them a mighty lot by\\r\\nbreaking out that sled. The runners are froze fast. Throw your weight against\\r\\nthe gee-pole, right and left, and break it out.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA third time the attempt was made, but this time, following the advice, Hal\\r\\nbroke out the runners which had been frozen to the snow. The overloaded and\\r\\nunwieldy sled forged ahead, Buck and his mates struggling frantically under the\\r\\nrain of blows. A hundred yards ahead the path turned and sloped steeply into\\r\\nthe main street. It would have required an experienced man to keep the\\r\\ntop-heavy sled upright, and Hal was not such a man. As they swung on the turn\\r\\nthe sled went over, spilling half its load through the loose lashings. The dogs\\r\\nnever stopped. The lightened sled bounded on its side behind them. They were\\r\\nangry because of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust load. Buck\\r\\nwas raging. He broke into a run, the team following his lead. Hal cried\\r\\n“Whoa! whoa!” but they gave no heed. He tripped and was pulled off\\r\\nhis feet. The capsized sled ground over him, and the dogs dashed on up the\\r\\nstreet, adding to the gayety of Skaguay as they scattered the remainder of the\\r\\noutfit along its chief thoroughfare.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nKind-hearted citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered belongings.\\r\\nAlso, they gave advice. Half the load and twice the dogs, if they ever expected\\r\\nto reach Dawson, was what was said. Hal and his sister and brother-in-law\\r\\nlistened unwillingly, pitched tent, and overhauled the outfit. Canned goods\\r\\nwere turned out that made men laugh, for canned goods on the Long Trail is a\\r\\nthing to dream about. “Blankets for a hotel” quoth one of the men\\r\\nwho laughed and helped. “Half as many is too much; get rid of them. Throw\\r\\naway that tent, and all those dishes,—who’s going to wash them,\\r\\nanyway? Good Lord, do you think you’re travelling on a Pullman?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd so it went, the inexorable elimination of the superfluous. Mercedes cried\\r\\nwhen her clothes-bags were dumped on the ground and article after article was\\r\\nthrown out. She cried in general, and she cried in particular over each\\r\\ndiscarded thing. She clasped hands about knees, rocking back and forth\\r\\nbroken-heartedly. She averred she would not go an inch, not for a dozen\\r\\nCharleses. She appealed to everybody and to everything, finally wiping her eyes\\r\\nand proceeding to cast out even articles of apparel that were imperative\\r\\nnecessaries. And in her zeal, when she had finished with her own, she attacked\\r\\nthe belongings of her men and went through them like a tornado.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis accomplished, the outfit, though cut in half, was still a formidable bulk.\\r\\nCharles and Hal went out in the evening and bought six Outside dogs. These,\\r\\nadded to the six of the original team, and Teek and Koona, the huskies obtained\\r\\nat the Rink Rapids on the record trip, brought the team up to fourteen. But the\\r\\nOutside dogs, though practically broken in since their landing, did not amount\\r\\nto much. Three were short-haired pointers, one was a Newfoundland, and the\\r\\nother two were mongrels of indeterminate breed. They did not seem to know\\r\\nanything, these newcomers. Buck and his comrades looked upon them with disgust,\\r\\nand though he speedily taught them their places and what not to do, he could\\r\\nnot teach them what to do. They did not take kindly to trace and trail. With\\r\\nthe exception of the two mongrels, they were bewildered and spirit-broken by\\r\\nthe strange savage environment in which they found themselves and by the ill\\r\\ntreatment they had received. The two mongrels were without spirit at all; bones\\r\\nwere the only things breakable about them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith the newcomers hopeless and forlorn, and the old team worn out by\\r\\ntwenty-five hundred miles of continuous trail, the outlook was anything but\\r\\nbright. The two men, however, were quite cheerful. And they were proud, too.\\r\\nThey were doing the thing in style, with fourteen dogs. They had seen other\\r\\nsleds depart over the Pass for Dawson, or come in from Dawson, but never had\\r\\nthey seen a sled with so many as fourteen dogs. In the nature of Arctic travel\\r\\nthere was a reason why fourteen dogs should not drag one sled, and that was\\r\\nthat one sled could not carry the food for fourteen dogs. But Charles and Hal\\r\\ndid not know this. They had worked the trip out with a pencil, so much to a\\r\\ndog, so many dogs, so many days, Q.E.D. Mercedes looked over their shoulders\\r\\nand nodded comprehensively, it was all so very simple.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLate next morning Buck led the long team up the street. There was nothing\\r\\nlively about it, no snap or go in him and his fellows. They were starting dead\\r\\nweary. Four times he had covered the distance between Salt Water and Dawson,\\r\\nand the knowledge that, jaded and tired, he was facing the same trail once\\r\\nmore, made him bitter. His heart was not in the work, nor was the heart of any\\r\\ndog. The Outsides were timid and frightened, the Insides without confidence in\\r\\ntheir masters.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and the woman.\\r\\nThey did not know how to do anything, and as the days went by it became\\r\\napparent that they could not learn. They were slack in all things, without\\r\\norder or discipline. It took them half the night to pitch a slovenly camp, and\\r\\nhalf the morning to break that camp and get the sled loaded in fashion so\\r\\nslovenly that for the rest of the day they were occupied in stopping and\\r\\nrearranging the load. Some days they did not make ten miles. On other days they\\r\\nwere unable to get started at all. And on no day did they succeed in making\\r\\nmore than half the distance used by the men as a basis in their dog-food\\r\\ncomputation.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was inevitable that they should go short on dog-food. But they hastened it\\r\\nby overfeeding, bringing the day nearer when underfeeding would commence. The\\r\\nOutside dogs, whose digestions had not been trained by chronic famine to make\\r\\nthe most of little, had voracious appetites. And when, in addition to this, the\\r\\nworn-out huskies pulled weakly, Hal decided that the orthodox ration was too\\r\\nsmall. He doubled it. And to cap it all, when Mercedes, with tears in her\\r\\npretty eyes and a quaver in her throat, could not cajole him into giving the\\r\\ndogs still more, she stole from the fish-sacks and fed them slyly. But it was\\r\\nnot food that Buck and the huskies needed, but rest. And though they were\\r\\nmaking poor time, the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen came the underfeeding. Hal awoke one day to the fact that his dog-food was\\r\\nhalf gone and the distance only quarter covered; further, that for love or\\r\\nmoney no additional dog-food was to be obtained. So he cut down even the\\r\\northodox ration and tried to increase the day’s travel. His sister and\\r\\nbrother-in-law seconded him; but they were frustrated by their heavy outfit and\\r\\ntheir own incompetence. It was a simple matter to give the dogs less food; but\\r\\nit was impossible to make the dogs travel faster, while their own inability to\\r\\nget under way earlier in the morning prevented them from travelling longer\\r\\nhours. Not only did they not know how to work dogs, but they did not know how\\r\\nto work themselves.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe first to go was Dub. Poor blundering thief that he was, always getting\\r\\ncaught and punished, he had none the less been a faithful worker. His wrenched\\r\\nshoulder-blade, untreated and unrested, went from bad to worse, till finally\\r\\nHal shot him with the big Colt’s revolver. It is a saying of the country\\r\\nthat an Outside dog starves to death on the ration of the husky, so the six\\r\\nOutside dogs under Buck could do no less than die on half the ration of the\\r\\nhusky. The Newfoundland went first, followed by the three short-haired\\r\\npointers, the two mongrels hanging more grittily on to life, but going in the\\r\\nend.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBy this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the Southland had fallen\\r\\naway from the three people. Shorn of its glamour and romance, Arctic travel\\r\\nbecame to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and womanhood. Mercedes\\r\\nceased weeping over the dogs, being too occupied with weeping over herself and\\r\\nwith quarrelling with her husband and brother. To quarrel was the one thing\\r\\nthey were never too weary to do. Their irritability arose out of their misery,\\r\\nincreased with it, doubled upon it, outdistanced it. The wonderful patience of\\r\\nthe trail which comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore, and remain sweet of\\r\\nspeech and kindly, did not come to these two men and the woman. They had no\\r\\ninkling of such a patience. They were stiff and in pain; their muscles ached,\\r\\ntheir bones ached, their very hearts ached; and because of this they became\\r\\nsharp of speech, and hard words were first on their lips in the morning and\\r\\nlast at night.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nCharles and Hal wrangled whenever Mercedes gave them a chance. It was the\\r\\ncherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the work, and\\r\\nneither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity. Sometimes Mercedes\\r\\nsided with her husband, sometimes with her brother. The result was a beautiful\\r\\nand unending family quarrel. Starting from a dispute as to which should chop a\\r\\nfew sticks for the fire (a dispute which concerned only Charles and Hal),\\r\\npresently would be lugged in the rest of the family, fathers, mothers, uncles,\\r\\ncousins, people thousands of miles away, and some of them dead. That\\r\\nHal’s views on art, or the sort of society plays his mother’s\\r\\nbrother wrote, should have anything to do with the chopping of a few sticks of\\r\\nfirewood, passes comprehension; nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend\\r\\nin that direction as in the direction of Charles’s political prejudices.\\r\\nAnd that Charles’s sister’s tale-bearing tongue should be relevant\\r\\nto the building of a Yukon fire, was apparent only to Mercedes, who disburdened\\r\\nherself of copious opinions upon that topic, and incidentally upon a few other\\r\\ntraits unpleasantly peculiar to her husband’s family. In the meantime the\\r\\nfire remained unbuilt, the camp half pitched, and the dogs unfed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMercedes nursed a special grievance—the grievance of sex. She was pretty\\r\\nand soft, and had been chivalrously treated all her days. But the present\\r\\ntreatment by her husband and brother was everything save chivalrous. It was her\\r\\ncustom to be helpless. They complained. Upon which impeachment of what to her\\r\\nwas her most essential sex-prerogative, she made their lives unendurable. She\\r\\nno longer considered the dogs, and because she was sore and tired, she\\r\\npersisted in riding on the sled. She was pretty and soft, but she weighed one\\r\\nhundred and twenty pounds—a lusty last straw to the load dragged by the\\r\\nweak and starving animals. She rode for days, till they fell in the traces and\\r\\nthe sled stood still. Charles and Hal begged her to get off and walk, pleaded\\r\\nwith her, entreated, the while she wept and importuned Heaven with a recital of\\r\\ntheir brutality.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength. They never did it\\r\\nagain. She let her legs go limp like a spoiled child, and sat down on the\\r\\ntrail. They went on their way, but she did not move. After they had travelled\\r\\nthree miles they unloaded the sled, came back for her, and by main strength put\\r\\nher on the sled again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering of their\\r\\nanimals. Hal’s theory, which he practised on others, was that one must\\r\\nget hardened. He had started out preaching it to his sister and brother-in-law.\\r\\nFailing there, he hammered it into the dogs with a club. At the Five Fingers\\r\\nthe dog-food gave out, and a toothless old squaw offered to trade them a few\\r\\npounds of frozen horse-hide for the Colt’s revolver that kept the big\\r\\nhunting-knife company at Hal’s hip. A poor substitute for food was this\\r\\nhide, just as it had been stripped from the starved horses of the cattlemen six\\r\\nmonths back. In its frozen state it was more like strips of galvanized iron,\\r\\nand when a dog wrestled it into his stomach it thawed into thin and\\r\\ninnutritious leathery strings and into a mass of short hair, irritating and\\r\\nindigestible.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd through it all Buck staggered along at the head of the team as in a\\r\\nnightmare. He pulled when he could; when he could no longer pull, he fell down\\r\\nand remained down till blows from whip or club drove him to his feet again. All\\r\\nthe stiffness and gloss had gone out of his beautiful furry coat. The hair hung\\r\\ndown, limp and draggled, or matted with dried blood where Hal’s club had\\r\\nbruised him. His muscles had wasted away to knotty strings, and the flesh pads\\r\\nhad disappeared, so that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined\\r\\ncleanly through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness. It was\\r\\nheartbreaking, only Buck’s heart was unbreakable. The man in the red\\r\\nsweater had proved that.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs it was with Buck, so was it with his mates. They were perambulating\\r\\nskeletons. There were seven all together, including him. In their very great\\r\\nmisery they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the bruise of the\\r\\nclub. The pain of the beating was dull and distant, just as the things their\\r\\neyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and distant. They were not half\\r\\nliving, or quarter living. They were simply so many bags of bones in which\\r\\nsparks of life fluttered faintly. When a halt was made, they dropped down in\\r\\nthe traces like dead dogs, and the spark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out.\\r\\nAnd when the club or whip fell upon them, the spark fluttered feebly up, and\\r\\nthey tottered to their feet and staggered on.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere came a day when Billee, the good-natured, fell and could not rise. Hal\\r\\nhad traded off his revolver, so he took the axe and knocked Billee on the head\\r\\nas he lay in the traces, then cut the carcass out of the harness and dragged it\\r\\nto one side. Buck saw, and his mates saw, and they knew that this thing was\\r\\nvery close to them. On the next day Koona went, and but five of them remained:\\r\\nJoe, too far gone to be malignant; Pike, crippled and limping, only half\\r\\nconscious and not conscious enough longer to malinger; Sol-leks, the one-eyed,\\r\\nstill faithful to the toil of trace and trail, and mournful in that he had so\\r\\nlittle strength with which to pull; Teek, who had not travelled so far that\\r\\nwinter and who was now beaten more than the others because he was fresher; and\\r\\nBuck, still at the head of the team, but no longer enforcing discipline or\\r\\nstriving to enforce it, blind with weakness half the time and keeping the trail\\r\\nby the loom of it and by the dim feel of his feet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was beautiful spring weather, but neither dogs nor humans were aware of it.\\r\\nEach day the sun rose earlier and set later. It was dawn by three in the\\r\\nmorning, and twilight lingered till nine at night. The whole long day was a\\r\\nblaze of sunshine. The ghostly winter silence had given way to the great spring\\r\\nmurmur of awakening life. This murmur arose from all the land, fraught with the\\r\\njoy of living. It came from the things that lived and moved again, things which\\r\\nhad been as dead and which had not moved during the long months of frost. The\\r\\nsap was rising in the pines. The willows and aspens were bursting out in young\\r\\nbuds. Shrubs and vines were putting on fresh garbs of green. Crickets sang in\\r\\nthe nights, and in the days all manner of creeping, crawling things rustled\\r\\nforth into the sun. Partridges and woodpeckers were booming and knocking in the\\r\\nforest. Squirrels were chattering, birds singing, and overhead honked the\\r\\nwild-fowl driving up from the south in cunning wedges that split the air.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFrom every hill slope came the trickle of running water, the music of unseen\\r\\nfountains. All things were thawing, bending, snapping. The Yukon was straining\\r\\nto break loose the ice that bound it down. It ate away from beneath; the sun\\r\\nate from above. Air-holes formed, fissures sprang and spread apart, while thin\\r\\nsections of ice fell through bodily into the river. And amid all this bursting,\\r\\nrending, throbbing of awakening life, under the blazing sun and through the\\r\\nsoft-sighing breezes, like wayfarers to death, staggered the two men, the\\r\\nwoman, and the huskies.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith the dogs falling, Mercedes weeping and riding, Hal swearing innocuously,\\r\\nand Charles’s eyes wistfully watering, they staggered into John\\r\\nThornton’s camp at the mouth of White River. When they halted, the dogs\\r\\ndropped down as though they had all been struck dead. Mercedes dried her eyes\\r\\nand looked at John Thornton. Charles sat down on a log to rest. He sat down\\r\\nvery slowly and painstakingly what of his great stiffness. Hal did the talking.\\r\\nJohn Thornton was whittling the last touches on an axe-handle he had made from\\r\\na stick of birch. He whittled and listened, gave monosyllabic replies, and,\\r\\nwhen it was asked, terse advice. He knew the breed, and he gave his advice in\\r\\nthe certainty that it would not be followed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail and\\r\\nthat the best thing for us to do was to lay over,” Hal said in response\\r\\nto Thornton’s warning to take no more chances on the rotten ice.\\r\\n“They told us we couldn’t make White River, and here we are.”\\r\\nThis last with a sneering ring of triumph in it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And they told you true,” John Thornton answered. “The\\r\\nbottom’s likely to drop out at any moment. Only fools, with the blind\\r\\nluck of fools, could have made it. I tell you straight, I wouldn’t risk\\r\\nmy carcass on that ice for all the gold in Alaska.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That’s because you’re not a fool, I suppose,” said\\r\\nHal. “All the same, we’ll go on to Dawson.” He uncoiled his\\r\\nwhip. “Get up there, Buck! Hi! Get up there! Mush on!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThornton went on whittling. It was idle, he knew, to get between a fool and his\\r\\nfolly; while two or three fools more or less would not alter the scheme of\\r\\nthings.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the team did not get up at the command. It had long since passed into the\\r\\nstage where blows were required to rouse it. The whip flashed out, here and\\r\\nthere, on its merciless errands. John Thornton compressed his lips. Sol-leks\\r\\nwas the first to crawl to his feet. Teek followed. Joe came next, yelping with\\r\\npain. Pike made painful efforts. Twice he fell over, when half up, and on the\\r\\nthird attempt managed to rise. Buck made no effort. He lay quietly where he had\\r\\nfallen. The lash bit into him again and again, but he neither whined nor\\r\\nstruggled. Several times Thornton started, as though to speak, but changed his\\r\\nmind. A moisture came into his eyes, and, as the whipping continued, he arose\\r\\nand walked irresolutely up and down.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was the first time Buck had failed, in itself a sufficient reason to drive\\r\\nHal into a rage. He exchanged the whip for the customary club. Buck refused to\\r\\nmove under the rain of heavier blows which now fell upon him. Like his mates,\\r\\nhe was barely able to get up, but, unlike them, he had made up his mind not to\\r\\nget up. He had a vague feeling of impending doom. This had been strong upon him\\r\\nwhen he pulled in to the bank, and it had not departed from him. What of the\\r\\nthin and rotten ice he had felt under his feet all day, it seemed that he\\r\\nsensed disaster close at hand, out there ahead on the ice where his master was\\r\\ntrying to drive him. He refused to stir. So greatly had he suffered, and so far\\r\\ngone was he, that the blows did not hurt much. And as they continued to fall\\r\\nupon him, the spark of life within flickered and went down. It was nearly out.\\r\\nHe felt strangely numb. As though from a great distance, he was aware that he\\r\\nwas being beaten. The last sensations of pain left him. He no longer felt\\r\\nanything, though very faintly he could hear the impact of the club upon his\\r\\nbody. But it was no longer his body, it seemed so far away.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was inarticulate and\\r\\nmore like the cry of an animal, John Thornton sprang upon the man who wielded\\r\\nthe club. Hal was hurled backward, as though struck by a falling tree. Mercedes\\r\\nscreamed. Charles looked on wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get\\r\\nup because of his stiffness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJohn Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, too convulsed\\r\\nwith rage to speak.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you strike that dog again, I’ll kill you,” he at last\\r\\nmanaged to say in a choking voice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s my dog,” Hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth\\r\\nas he came back. “Get out of my way, or I’ll fix you. I’m\\r\\ngoing to Dawson.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThornton stood between him and Buck, and evinced no intention of getting out of\\r\\nthe way. Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed,\\r\\nand manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria. Thornton rapped Hal’s\\r\\nknuckles with the axe-handle, knocking the knife to the ground. He rapped his\\r\\nknuckles again as he tried to pick it up. Then he stooped, picked it up\\r\\nhimself, and with two strokes cut Buck’s traces.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHal had no fight left in him. Besides, his hands were full with his sister, or\\r\\nhis arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of further use in hauling\\r\\nthe sled. A few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river.\\r\\nBuck heard them go and raised his head to see, Pike was leading, Sol-leks was\\r\\nat the wheel, and between were Joe and Teek. They were limping and staggering.\\r\\nMercedes was riding the loaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles\\r\\nstumbled along in the rear.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly hands\\r\\nsearched for broken bones. By the time his search had disclosed nothing more\\r\\nthan many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the sled was a quarter of\\r\\na mile away. Dog and man watched it crawling along over the ice. Suddenly, they\\r\\nsaw its back end drop down, as into a rut, and the gee-pole, with Hal clinging\\r\\nto it, jerk into the air. Mercedes’s scream came to their ears. They saw\\r\\nCharles turn and make one step to run back, and then a whole section of ice\\r\\ngive way and dogs and humans disappear. A yawning hole was all that was to be\\r\\nseen. The bottom had dropped out of the trail.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJohn Thornton and Buck looked at each other.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You poor devil,” said John Thornton, and Buck licked his hand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VI.',\n"," 'For the Love of a Man\\n\\r\\nWhen John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December his partners had\\r\\nmade him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves up the river\\r\\nto get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson. He was still limping slightly at the\\r\\ntime he rescued Buck, but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp\\r\\nleft him. And here, lying by the river bank through the long spring days,\\r\\nwatching the running water, listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum\\r\\nof nature, Buck slowly won back his strength.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles, and it\\r\\nmust be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his muscles\\r\\nswelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. For that matter, they\\r\\nwere all loafing,—Buck, John Thornton, and Skeet and Nig,—waiting\\r\\nfor the raft to come that was to carry them down to Dawson. Skeet was a little\\r\\nIrish setter who early made friends with Buck, who, in a dying condition, was\\r\\nunable to resent her first advances. She had the doctor trait which some dogs\\r\\npossess; and as a mother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed\\r\\nBuck’s wounds. Regularly, each morning after he had finished his\\r\\nbreakfast, she performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her\\r\\nministrations as much as he did for Thornton’s. Nig, equally friendly,\\r\\nthough less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and half\\r\\ndeerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo Buck’s surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him. They\\r\\nseemed to share the kindliness and largeness of John Thornton. As Buck grew\\r\\nstronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games, in which Thornton\\r\\nhimself could not forbear to join; and in this fashion Buck romped through his\\r\\nconvalescence and into a new existence. Love, genuine passionate love, was his\\r\\nfor the first time. This he had never experienced at Judge Miller’s down\\r\\nin the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. With the Judge’s sons, hunting and\\r\\ntramping, it had been a working partnership; with the Judge’s grandsons,\\r\\na sort of pompous guardianship; and with the Judge himself, a stately and\\r\\ndignified friendship. But love that was feverish and burning, that was\\r\\nadoration, that was madness, it had taken John Thornton to arouse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis man had saved his life, which was something; but, further, he was the\\r\\nideal master. Other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a sense of duty\\r\\nand business expediency; he saw to the welfare of his as if they were his own\\r\\nchildren, because he could not help it. And he saw further. He never forgot a\\r\\nkindly greeting or a cheering word, and to sit down for a long talk with them\\r\\n(“gas” he called it) was as much his delight as theirs. He had a\\r\\nway of taking Buck’s head roughly between his hands, and resting his own\\r\\nhead upon Buck’s, of shaking him back and forth, the while calling him\\r\\nill names that to Buck were love names. Buck knew no greater joy than that\\r\\nrough embrace and the sound of murmured oaths, and at each jerk back and forth\\r\\nit seemed that his heart would be shaken out of his body so great was its\\r\\necstasy. And when, released, he sprang to his feet, his mouth laughing, his\\r\\neyes eloquent, his throat vibrant with unuttered sound, and in that fashion\\r\\nremained without movement, John Thornton would reverently exclaim, “God!\\r\\nyou can all but speak!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt. He would often seize\\r\\nThornton’s hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the flesh bore\\r\\nthe impress of his teeth for some time afterward. And as Buck understood the\\r\\noaths to be love words, so the man understood this feigned bite for a caress.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor the most part, however, Buck’s love was expressed in adoration. While\\r\\nhe went wild with happiness when Thornton touched him or spoke to him, he did\\r\\nnot seek these tokens. Unlike Skeet, who was wont to shove her nose under\\r\\nThornton’s hand and nudge and nudge till petted, or Nig, who would stalk\\r\\nup and rest his great head on Thornton’s knee, Buck was content to adore\\r\\nat a distance. He would lie by the hour, eager, alert, at Thornton’s\\r\\nfeet, looking up into his face, dwelling upon it, studying it, following with\\r\\nkeenest interest each fleeting expression, every movement or change of feature.\\r\\nOr, as chance might have it, he would lie farther away, to the side or rear,\\r\\nwatching the outlines of the man and the occasional movements of his body. And\\r\\noften, such was the communion in which they lived, the strength of Buck’s\\r\\ngaze would draw John Thornton’s head around, and he would return the\\r\\ngaze, without speech, his heart shining out of his eyes as Buck’s heart\\r\\nshone out.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor a long time after his rescue, Buck did not like Thornton to get out of his\\r\\nsight. From the moment he left the tent to when he entered it again, Buck would\\r\\nfollow at his heels. His transient masters since he had come into the Northland\\r\\nhad bred in him a fear that no master could be permanent. He was afraid that\\r\\nThornton would pass out of his life as Perrault and François and the Scotch\\r\\nhalf-breed had passed out. Even in the night, in his dreams, he was haunted by\\r\\nthis fear. At such times he would shake off sleep and creep through the chill\\r\\nto the flap of the tent, where he would stand and listen to the sound of his\\r\\nmaster’s breathing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut in spite of this great love he bore John Thornton, which seemed to bespeak\\r\\nthe soft civilizing influence, the strain of the primitive, which the Northland\\r\\nhad aroused in him, remained alive and active. Faithfulness and devotion,\\r\\nthings born of fire and roof, were his; yet he retained his wildness and\\r\\nwiliness. He was a thing of the wild, come in from the wild to sit by John\\r\\nThornton’s fire, rather than a dog of the soft Southland stamped with the\\r\\nmarks of generations of civilization. Because of his very great love, he could\\r\\nnot steal from this man, but from any other man, in any other camp, he did not\\r\\nhesitate an instant; while the cunning with which he stole enabled him to\\r\\nescape detection.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs, and he fought as\\r\\nfiercely as ever and more shrewdly. Skeet and Nig were too good-natured for\\r\\nquarrelling,—besides, they belonged to John Thornton; but the strange\\r\\ndog, no matter what the breed or valor, swiftly acknowledged Buck’s\\r\\nsupremacy or found himself struggling for life with a terrible antagonist. And\\r\\nBuck was merciless. He had learned well the law of club and fang, and he never\\r\\nforewent an advantage or drew back from a foe he had started on the way to\\r\\nDeath. He had lessoned from Spitz, and from the chief fighting dogs of the\\r\\npolice and mail, and knew there was no middle course. He must master or be\\r\\nmastered; while to show mercy was a weakness. Mercy did not exist in the\\r\\nprimordial life. It was misunderstood for fear, and such misunderstandings made\\r\\nfor death. Kill or be killed, eat or be eaten, was the law; and this mandate,\\r\\ndown out of the depths of Time, he obeyed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn. He linked\\r\\nthe past with the present, and the eternity behind him throbbed through him in\\r\\na mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and seasons swayed. He sat by\\r\\nJohn Thornton’s fire, a broad-breasted dog, white-fanged and long-furred;\\r\\nbut behind him were the shades of all manner of dogs, half-wolves and wild\\r\\nwolves, urgent and prompting, tasting the savor of the meat he ate, thirsting\\r\\nfor the water he drank, scenting the wind with him, listening with him and\\r\\ntelling him the sounds made by the wild life in the forest, dictating his\\r\\nmoods, directing his actions, lying down to sleep with him when he lay down,\\r\\nand dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff of his\\r\\ndreams.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo peremptorily did these shades beckon him, that each day mankind and the\\r\\nclaims of mankind slipped farther from him. Deep in the forest a call was\\r\\nsounding, and as often as he heard this call, mysteriously thrilling and\\r\\nluring, he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire and the beaten earth\\r\\naround it, and to plunge into the forest, and on and on, he knew not where or\\r\\nwhy; nor did he wonder where or why, the call sounding imperiously, deep in the\\r\\nforest. But as often as he gained the soft unbroken earth and the green shade,\\r\\nthe love for John Thornton drew him back to the fire again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThornton alone held him. The rest of mankind was as nothing. Chance travellers\\r\\nmight praise or pet him; but he was cold under it all, and from a too\\r\\ndemonstrative man he would get up and walk away. When Thornton’s\\r\\npartners, Hans and Pete, arrived on the long-expected raft, Buck refused to\\r\\nnotice them till he learned they were close to Thornton; after that he\\r\\ntolerated them in a passive sort of way, accepting favors from them as though\\r\\nhe favored them by accepting. They were of the same large type as Thornton,\\r\\nliving close to the earth, thinking simply and seeing clearly; and ere they\\r\\nswung the raft into the big eddy by the saw-mill at Dawson, they understood\\r\\nBuck and his ways, and did not insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with\\r\\nSkeet and Nig.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor Thornton, however, his love seemed to grow and grow. He, alone among men,\\r\\ncould put a pack upon Buck’s back in the summer travelling. Nothing was\\r\\ntoo great for Buck to do, when Thornton commanded. One day (they had\\r\\ngrub-staked themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left Dawson for the\\r\\nhead-waters of the Tanana) the men and dogs were sitting on the crest of a\\r\\ncliff which fell away, straight down, to naked bed-rock three hundred feet\\r\\nbelow. John Thornton was sitting near the edge, Buck at his shoulder. A\\r\\nthoughtless whim seized Thornton, and he drew the attention of Hans and Pete to\\r\\nthe experiment he had in mind. “Jump, Buck!” he commanded, sweeping\\r\\nhis arm out and over the chasm. The next instant he was grappling with Buck on\\r\\nthe extreme edge, while Hans and Pete were dragging them back into safety.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s uncanny,” Pete said, after it was over and they had\\r\\ncaught their speech.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThornton shook his head. “No, it is splendid, and it is terrible, too. Do\\r\\nyou know, it sometimes makes me afraid.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while\\r\\nhe’s around,” Pete announced conclusively, nodding his head toward\\r\\nBuck.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Py Jingo!” was Hans’s contribution. “Not mineself\\r\\neither.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was at Circle City, ere the year was out, that Pete’s apprehensions\\r\\nwere realized. “Black” Burton, a man evil-tempered and malicious,\\r\\nhad been picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar, when Thornton stepped\\r\\ngood-naturedly between. Buck, as was his custom, was lying in a corner, head on\\r\\npaws, watching his master’s every action. Burton struck out, without\\r\\nwarning, straight from the shoulder. Thornton was sent spinning, and saved\\r\\nhimself from falling only by clutching the rail of the bar.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThose who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp, but a something\\r\\nwhich is best described as a roar, and they saw Buck’s body rise up in\\r\\nthe air as he left the floor for Burton’s throat. The man saved his life\\r\\nby instinctively throwing out his arm, but was hurled backward to the floor\\r\\nwith Buck on top of him. Buck loosed his teeth from the flesh of the arm and\\r\\ndrove in again for the throat. This time the man succeeded only in partly\\r\\nblocking, and his throat was torn open. Then the crowd was upon Buck, and he\\r\\nwas driven off; but while a surgeon checked the bleeding, he prowled up and\\r\\ndown, growling furiously, attempting to rush in, and being forced back by an\\r\\narray of hostile clubs. A “miners’ meeting,” called on the\\r\\nspot, decided that the dog had sufficient provocation, and Buck was discharged.\\r\\nBut his reputation was made, and from that day his name spread through every\\r\\ncamp in Alaska.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLater on, in the fall of the year, he saved John Thornton’s life in quite\\r\\nanother fashion. The three partners were lining a long and narrow poling-boat\\r\\ndown a bad stretch of rapids on the Forty-Mile Creek. Hans and Pete moved along\\r\\nthe bank, snubbing with a thin Manila rope from tree to tree, while Thornton\\r\\nremained in the boat, helping its descent by means of a pole, and shouting\\r\\ndirections to the shore. Buck, on the bank, worried and anxious, kept abreast\\r\\nof the boat, his eyes never off his master.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt a particularly bad spot, where a ledge of barely submerged rocks jutted out\\r\\ninto the river, Hans cast off the rope, and, while Thornton poled the boat out\\r\\ninto the stream, ran down the bank with the end in his hand to snub the boat\\r\\nwhen it had cleared the ledge. This it did, and was flying down-stream in a\\r\\ncurrent as swift as a mill-race, when Hans checked it with the rope and checked\\r\\ntoo suddenly. The boat flirted over and snubbed in to the bank bottom up, while\\r\\nThornton, flung sheer out of it, was carried down-stream toward the worst part\\r\\nof the rapids, a stretch of wild water in which no swimmer could live.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck had sprung in on the instant; and at the end of three hundred yards, amid\\r\\na mad swirl of water, he overhauled Thornton. When he felt him grasp his tail,\\r\\nBuck headed for the bank, swimming with all his splendid strength. But the\\r\\nprogress shoreward was slow; the progress down-stream amazingly rapid. From\\r\\nbelow came the fatal roaring where the wild current went wilder and was rent in\\r\\nshreds and spray by the rocks which thrust through like the teeth of an\\r\\nenormous comb. The suck of the water as it took the beginning of the last steep\\r\\npitch was frightful, and Thornton knew that the shore was impossible. He\\r\\nscraped furiously over a rock, bruised across a second, and struck a third with\\r\\ncrushing force. He clutched its slippery top with both hands, releasing Buck,\\r\\nand above the roar of the churning water shouted: “Go, Buck! Go!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck could not hold his own, and swept on down-stream, struggling desperately,\\r\\nbut unable to win back. When he heard Thornton’s command repeated, he\\r\\npartly reared out of the water, throwing his head high, as though for a last\\r\\nlook, then turned obediently toward the bank. He swam powerfully and was\\r\\ndragged ashore by Pete and Hans at the very point where swimming ceased to be\\r\\npossible and destruction began.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey knew that the time a man could cling to a slippery rock in the face of\\r\\nthat driving current was a matter of minutes, and they ran as fast as they\\r\\ncould up the bank to a point far above where Thornton was hanging on. They\\r\\nattached the line with which they had been snubbing the boat to Buck’s\\r\\nneck and shoulders, being careful that it should neither strangle him nor\\r\\nimpede his swimming, and launched him into the stream. He struck out boldly,\\r\\nbut not straight enough into the stream. He discovered the mistake too late,\\r\\nwhen Thornton was abreast of him and a bare half-dozen strokes away while he\\r\\nwas being carried helplessly past.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHans promptly snubbed with the rope, as though Buck were a boat. The rope thus\\r\\ntightening on him in the sweep of the current, he was jerked under the surface,\\r\\nand under the surface he remained till his body struck against the bank and he\\r\\nwas hauled out. He was half drowned, and Hans and Pete threw themselves upon\\r\\nhim, pounding the breath into him and the water out of him. He staggered to his\\r\\nfeet and fell down. The faint sound of Thornton’s voice came to them, and\\r\\nthough they could not make out the words of it, they knew that he was in his\\r\\nextremity. His master’s voice acted on Buck like an electric shock, He\\r\\nsprang to his feet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of his\\r\\nprevious departure.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAgain the rope was attached and he was launched, and again he struck out, but\\r\\nthis time straight into the stream. He had miscalculated once, but he would not\\r\\nbe guilty of it a second time. Hans paid out the rope, permitting no slack,\\r\\nwhile Pete kept it clear of coils. Buck held on till he was on a line straight\\r\\nabove Thornton; then he turned, and with the speed of an express train headed\\r\\ndown upon him. Thornton saw him coming, and, as Buck struck him like a\\r\\nbattering ram, with the whole force of the current behind him, he reached up\\r\\nand closed with both arms around the shaggy neck. Hans snubbed the rope around\\r\\nthe tree, and Buck and Thornton were jerked under the water. Strangling,\\r\\nsuffocating, sometimes one uppermost and sometimes the other, dragging over the\\r\\njagged bottom, smashing against rocks and snags, they veered in to the bank.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThornton came to, belly downward and being violently propelled back and forth\\r\\nacross a drift log by Hans and Pete. His first glance was for Buck, over whose\\r\\nlimp and apparently lifeless body Nig was setting up a howl, while Skeet was\\r\\nlicking the wet face and closed eyes. Thornton was himself bruised and\\r\\nbattered, and he went carefully over Buck’s body, when he had been\\r\\nbrought around, finding three broken ribs.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That settles it,” he announced. “We camp right here.”\\r\\nAnd camp they did, till Buck’s ribs knitted and he was able to travel.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThat winter, at Dawson, Buck performed another exploit, not so heroic, perhaps,\\r\\nbut one that put his name many notches higher on the totem-pole of Alaskan\\r\\nfame. This exploit was particularly gratifying to the three men; for they stood\\r\\nin need of the outfit which it furnished, and were enabled to make a\\r\\nlong-desired trip into the virgin East, where miners had not yet appeared. It\\r\\nwas brought about by a conversation in the Eldorado Saloon, in which men waxed\\r\\nboastful of their favorite dogs. Buck, because of his record, was the target\\r\\nfor these men, and Thornton was driven stoutly to defend him. At the end of\\r\\nhalf an hour one man stated that his dog could start a sled with five hundred\\r\\npounds and walk off with it; a second bragged six hundred for his dog; and a\\r\\nthird, seven hundred.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pooh! pooh!” said John Thornton; “Buck can start a thousand\\r\\npounds.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And break it out? and walk off with it for a hundred yards?”\\r\\ndemanded Matthewson, a Bonanza King, he of the seven hundred vaunt.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And break it out, and walk off with it for a hundred yards,” John\\r\\nThornton said coolly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well,” Matthewson said, slowly and deliberately, so that all could\\r\\nhear, “I’ve got a thousand dollars that says he can’t. And\\r\\nthere it is.” So saying, he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a\\r\\nbologna sausage down upon the bar.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNobody spoke. Thornton’s bluff, if bluff it was, had been called. He\\r\\ncould feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face. His tongue had tricked\\r\\nhim. He did not know whether Buck could start a thousand pounds. Half a ton!\\r\\nThe enormousness of it appalled him. He had great faith in Buck’s\\r\\nstrength and had often thought him capable of starting such a load; but never,\\r\\nas now, had he faced the possibility of it, the eyes of a dozen men fixed upon\\r\\nhim, silent and waiting. Further, he had no thousand dollars; nor had Hans or\\r\\nPete.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’ve got a sled standing outside now, with twenty fiftypound sacks\\r\\nof flour on it,” Matthewson went on with brutal directness; “so\\r\\ndon’t let that hinder you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThornton did not reply. He did not know what to say. He glanced from face to\\r\\nface in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of thought and is\\r\\nseeking somewhere to find the thing that will start it going again. The face of\\r\\nJim O’Brien, a Mastodon King and old-time comrade, caught his eyes. It\\r\\nwas as a cue to him, seeming to rouse him to do what he would never have\\r\\ndreamed of doing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Can you lend me a thousand?” he asked, almost in a whisper.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sure,” answered O’Brien, thumping down a plethoric sack by\\r\\nthe side of Matthewson’s. “Though it’s little faith I’m\\r\\nhaving, John, that the beast can do the trick.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test. The tables\\r\\nwere deserted, and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see the outcome of\\r\\nthe wager and to lay odds. Several hundred men, furred and mittened, banked\\r\\naround the sled within easy distance. Matthewson’s sled, loaded with a\\r\\nthousand pounds of flour, had been standing for a couple of hours, and in the\\r\\nintense cold (it was sixty below zero) the runners had frozen fast to the\\r\\nhard-packed snow. Men offered odds of two to one that Buck could not budge the\\r\\nsled. A quibble arose concerning the phrase “break out.”\\r\\nO’Brien contended it was Thornton’s privilege to knock the runners\\r\\nloose, leaving Buck to “break it out” from a dead standstill.\\r\\nMatthewson insisted that the phrase included breaking the runners from the\\r\\nfrozen grip of the snow. A majority of the men who had witnessed the making of\\r\\nthe bet decided in his favor, whereat the odds went up to three to one against\\r\\nBuck.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere were no takers. Not a man believed him capable of the feat. Thornton had\\r\\nbeen hurried into the wager, heavy with doubt; and now that he looked at the\\r\\nsled itself, the concrete fact, with the regular team of ten dogs curled up in\\r\\nthe snow before it, the more impossible the task appeared. Matthewson waxed\\r\\njubilant.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Three to one!” he proclaimed. “I’ll lay you another\\r\\nthousand at that figure, Thornton. What d’ye say?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThornton’s doubt was strong in his face, but his fighting spirit was\\r\\naroused—the fighting spirit that soars above odds, fails to recognize the\\r\\nimpossible, and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle. He called Hans and\\r\\nPete to him. Their sacks were slim, and with his own the three partners could\\r\\nrake together only two hundred dollars. In the ebb of their fortunes, this sum\\r\\nwas their total capital; yet they laid it unhesitatingly against\\r\\nMatthewson’s six hundred.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe team of ten dogs was unhitched, and Buck, with his own harness, was put\\r\\ninto the sled. He had caught the contagion of the excitement, and he felt that\\r\\nin some way he must do a great thing for John Thornton. Murmurs of admiration\\r\\nat his splendid appearance went up. He was in perfect condition, without an\\r\\nounce of superfluous flesh, and the one hundred and fifty pounds that he\\r\\nweighed were so many pounds of grit and virility. His furry coat shone with the\\r\\nsheen of silk. Down the neck and across the shoulders, his mane, in repose as\\r\\nit was, half bristled and seemed to lift with every movement, as though excess\\r\\nof vigor made each particular hair alive and active. The great breast and heavy\\r\\nfore legs were no more than in proportion with the rest of the body, where the\\r\\nmuscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin. Men felt these muscles and\\r\\nproclaimed them hard as iron, and the odds went down to two to one.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Gad, sir! Gad, sir!” stuttered a member of the latest dynasty, a\\r\\nking of the Skookum Benches. “I offer you eight hundred for him, sir,\\r\\nbefore the test, sir; eight hundred just as he stands.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThornton shook his head and stepped to Buck’s side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You must stand off from him,” Matthewson protested. “Free\\r\\nplay and plenty of room.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe crowd fell silent; only could be heard the voices of the gamblers vainly\\r\\noffering two to one. Everybody acknowledged Buck a magnificent animal, but\\r\\ntwenty fifty-pound sacks of flour bulked too large in their eyes for them to\\r\\nloosen their pouch-strings.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThornton knelt down by Buck’s side. He took his head in his two hands and\\r\\nrested cheek on cheek. He did not playfully shake him, as was his wont, or\\r\\nmurmur soft love curses; but he whispered in his ear. “As you love me,\\r\\nBuck. As you love me,” was what he whispered. Buck whined with suppressed\\r\\neagerness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe crowd was watching curiously. The affair was growing mysterious. It seemed\\r\\nlike a conjuration. As Thornton got to his feet, Buck seized his mittened hand\\r\\nbetween his jaws, pressing in with his teeth and releasing slowly,\\r\\nhalf-reluctantly. It was the answer, in terms, not of speech, but of love.\\r\\nThornton stepped well back.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now, Buck,” he said.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck tightened the traces, then slacked them for a matter of several inches. It\\r\\nwas the way he had learned.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Gee!” Thornton’s voice rang out, sharp in the tense silence.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck swung to the right, ending the movement in a plunge that took up the slack\\r\\nand with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty pounds. The load\\r\\nquivered, and from under the runners arose a crisp crackling.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Haw!” Thornton commanded.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck duplicated the manœuvre, this time to the left. The crackling turned into\\r\\na snapping, the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and grating several\\r\\ninches to the side. The sled was broken out. Men were holding their breaths,\\r\\nintensely unconscious of the fact.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now, MUSH!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThornton’s command cracked out like a pistol-shot. Buck threw himself\\r\\nforward, tightening the traces with a jarring lunge. His whole body was\\r\\ngathered compactly together in the tremendous effort, the muscles writhing and\\r\\nknotting like live things under the silky fur. His great chest was low to the\\r\\nground, his head forward and down, while his feet were flying like mad, the\\r\\nclaws scarring the hard-packed snow in parallel grooves. The sled swayed and\\r\\ntrembled, half-started forward. One of his feet slipped, and one man groaned\\r\\naloud. Then the sled lurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of\\r\\njerks, though it never really came to a dead stop again...half an inch...an\\r\\ninch... two inches... The jerks perceptibly diminished; as the sled gained\\r\\nmomentum, he caught them up, till it was moving steadily along.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMen gasped and began to breathe again, unaware that for a moment they had\\r\\nceased to breathe. Thornton was running behind, encouraging Buck with short,\\r\\ncheery words. The distance had been measured off, and as he neared the pile of\\r\\nfirewood which marked the end of the hundred yards, a cheer began to grow and\\r\\ngrow, which burst into a roar as he passed the firewood and halted at command.\\r\\nEvery man was tearing himself loose, even Matthewson. Hats and mittens were\\r\\nflying in the air. Men were shaking hands, it did not matter with whom, and\\r\\nbubbling over in a general incoherent babel.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Thornton fell on his knees beside Buck. Head was against head, and he was\\r\\nshaking him back and forth. Those who hurried up heard him cursing Buck, and he\\r\\ncursed him long and fervently, and softly and lovingly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Gad, sir! Gad, sir!” spluttered the Skookum Bench king.\\r\\n“I’ll give you a thousand for him, sir, a thousand,\\r\\nsir—twelve hundred, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThornton rose to his feet. His eyes were wet. The tears were streaming frankly\\r\\ndown his cheeks. “Sir,” he said to the Skookum Bench king,\\r\\n“no, sir. You can go to hell, sir. It’s the best I can do for you,\\r\\nsir.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck seized Thornton’s hand in his teeth. Thornton shook him back and\\r\\nforth. As though animated by a common impulse, the onlookers drew back to a\\r\\nrespectful distance; nor were they again indiscreet enough to interrupt.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VII.',\n"," 'The Sounding of the Call\\n\\r\\nWhen Buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for John Thornton, he\\r\\nmade it possible for his master to pay off certain debts and to journey with\\r\\nhis partners into the East after a fabled lost mine, the history of which was\\r\\nas old as the history of the country. Many men had sought it; few had found it;\\r\\nand more than a few there were who had never returned from the quest. This lost\\r\\nmine was steeped in tragedy and shrouded in mystery. No one knew of the first\\r\\nman. The oldest tradition stopped before it got back to him. From the beginning\\r\\nthere had been an ancient and ramshackle cabin. Dying men had sworn to it, and\\r\\nto the mine the site of which it marked, clinching their testimony with nuggets\\r\\nthat were unlike any known grade of gold in the Northland.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut no living man had looted this treasure house, and the dead were dead;\\r\\nwherefore John Thornton and Pete and Hans, with Buck and half a dozen other\\r\\ndogs, faced into the East on an unknown trail to achieve where men and dogs as\\r\\ngood as themselves had failed. They sledded seventy miles up the Yukon, swung\\r\\nto the left into the Stewart River, passed the Mayo and the McQuestion, and\\r\\nheld on until the Stewart itself became a streamlet, threading the upstanding\\r\\npeaks which marked the backbone of the continent.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJohn Thornton asked little of man or nature. He was unafraid of the wild. With\\r\\na handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the wilderness and fare\\r\\nwherever he pleased and as long as he pleased. Being in no haste, Indian\\r\\nfashion, he hunted his dinner in the course of the day’s travel; and if\\r\\nhe failed to find it, like the Indian, he kept on travelling, secure in the\\r\\nknowledge that sooner or later he would come to it. So, on this great journey\\r\\ninto the East, straight meat was the bill of fare, ammunition and tools\\r\\nprincipally made up the load on the sled, and the time-card was drawn upon the\\r\\nlimitless future.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo Buck it was boundless delight, this hunting, fishing, and indefinite\\r\\nwandering through strange places. For weeks at a time they would hold on\\r\\nsteadily, day after day; and for weeks upon end they would camp, here and\\r\\nthere, the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen muck and\\r\\ngravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the fire. Sometimes\\r\\nthey went hungry, sometimes they feasted riotously, all according to the\\r\\nabundance of game and the fortune of hunting. Summer arrived, and dogs and men\\r\\npacked on their backs, rafted across blue mountain lakes, and descended or\\r\\nascended unknown rivers in slender boats whipsawed from the standing forest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe months came and went, and back and forth they twisted through the uncharted\\r\\nvastness, where no men were and yet where men had been if the Lost Cabin were\\r\\ntrue. They went across divides in summer blizzards, shivered under the midnight\\r\\nsun on naked mountains between the timber line and the eternal snows, dropped\\r\\ninto summer valleys amid swarming gnats and flies, and in the shadows of\\r\\nglaciers picked strawberries and flowers as ripe and fair as any the Southland\\r\\ncould boast. In the fall of the year they penetrated a weird lake country, sad\\r\\nand silent, where wildfowl had been, but where then there was no life nor sign\\r\\nof life—only the blowing of chill winds, the forming of ice in sheltered\\r\\nplaces, and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of men who\\r\\nhad gone before. Once, they came upon a path blazed through the forest, an\\r\\nancient path, and the Lost Cabin seemed very near. But the path began nowhere\\r\\nand ended nowhere, and it remained mystery, as the man who made it and the\\r\\nreason he made it remained mystery. Another time they chanced upon the\\r\\ntime-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge, and amid the shreds of rotted blankets\\r\\nJohn Thornton found a long-barrelled flint-lock. He knew it for a Hudson Bay\\r\\nCompany gun of the young days in the Northwest, when such a gun was worth its\\r\\nheight in beaver skins packed flat, And that was all—no hint as to the\\r\\nman who in an early day had reared the lodge and left the gun among the\\r\\nblankets.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSpring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they found, not\\r\\nthe Lost Cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where the gold showed\\r\\nlike yellow butter across the bottom of the washing-pan. They sought no\\r\\nfarther. Each day they worked earned them thousands of dollars in clean dust\\r\\nand nuggets, and they worked every day. The gold was sacked in moose-hide bags,\\r\\nfifty pounds to the bag, and piled like so much firewood outside the\\r\\nspruce-bough lodge. Like giants they toiled, days flashing on the heels of days\\r\\nlike dreams as they heaped the treasure up.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing for the dogs to do, save the hauling in of meat now and again\\r\\nthat Thornton killed, and Buck spent long hours musing by the fire. The vision\\r\\nof the short-legged hairy man came to him more frequently, now that there was\\r\\nlittle work to be done; and often, blinking by the fire, Buck wandered with him\\r\\nin that other world which he remembered.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe salient thing of this other world seemed fear. When he watched the hairy\\r\\nman sleeping by the fire, head between his knees and hands clasped above, Buck\\r\\nsaw that he slept restlessly, with many starts and awakenings, at which times\\r\\nhe would peer fearfully into the darkness and fling more wood upon the fire.\\r\\nDid they walk by the beach of a sea, where the hairy man gathered shellfish and\\r\\nate them as he gathered, it was with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden\\r\\ndanger and with legs prepared to run like the wind at its first appearance.\\r\\nThrough the forest they crept noiselessly, Buck at the hairy man’s heels;\\r\\nand they were alert and vigilant, the pair of them, ears twitching and moving\\r\\nand nostrils quivering, for the man heard and smelled as keenly as Buck. The\\r\\nhairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as fast as on the\\r\\nground, swinging by the arms from limb to limb, sometimes a dozen feet apart,\\r\\nletting go and catching, never falling, never missing his grip. In fact, he\\r\\nseemed as much at home among the trees as on the ground; and Buck had memories\\r\\nof nights of vigil spent beneath trees wherein the hairy man roosted, holding\\r\\non tightly as he slept.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still sounding in\\r\\nthe depths of the forest. It filled him with a great unrest and strange\\r\\ndesires. It caused him to feel a vague, sweet gladness, and he was aware of\\r\\nwild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what. Sometimes he pursued the\\r\\ncall into the forest, looking for it as though it were a tangible thing,\\r\\nbarking softly or defiantly, as the mood might dictate. He would thrust his\\r\\nnose into the cool wood moss, or into the black soil where long grasses grew,\\r\\nand snort with joy at the fat earth smells; or he would crouch for hours, as if\\r\\nin concealment, behind fungus-covered trunks of fallen trees, wide-eyed and\\r\\nwide-eared to all that moved and sounded about him. It might be, lying thus,\\r\\nthat he hoped to surprise this call he could not understand. But he did not\\r\\nknow why he did these various things. He was impelled to do them, and did not\\r\\nreason about them at all.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIrresistible impulses seized him. He would be lying in camp, dozing lazily in\\r\\nthe heat of the day, when suddenly his head would lift and his ears cock up,\\r\\nintent and listening, and he would spring to his feet and dash away, and on and\\r\\non, for hours, through the forest aisles and across the open spaces where the\\r\\nniggerheads bunched. He loved to run down dry watercourses, and to creep and\\r\\nspy upon the bird life in the woods. For a day at a time he would lie in the\\r\\nunderbrush where he could watch the partridges drumming and strutting up and\\r\\ndown. But especially he loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer\\r\\nmidnights, listening to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest, reading\\r\\nsigns and sounds as man may read a book, and seeking for the mysterious\\r\\nsomething that called—called, waking or sleeping, at all times, for him\\r\\nto come.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne night he sprang from sleep with a start, eager-eyed, nostrils quivering and\\r\\nscenting, his mane bristling in recurrent waves. From the forest came the call\\r\\n(or one note of it, for the call was many noted), distinct and definite as\\r\\nnever before,—a long-drawn howl, like, yet unlike, any noise made by\\r\\nhusky dog. And he knew it, in the old familiar way, as a sound heard before. He\\r\\nsprang through the sleeping camp and in swift silence dashed through the woods.\\r\\nAs he drew closer to the cry he went more slowly, with caution in every\\r\\nmovement, till he came to an open place among the trees, and looking out saw,\\r\\nerect on haunches, with nose pointed to the sky, a long, lean, timber wolf.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe had made no noise, yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense his\\r\\npresence. Buck stalked into the open, half crouching, body gathered compactly\\r\\ntogether, tail straight and stiff, feet falling with unwonted care. Every\\r\\nmovement advertised commingled threatening and overture of friendliness. It was\\r\\nthe menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild beasts that prey. But the\\r\\nwolf fled at sight of him. He followed, with wild leapings, in a frenzy to\\r\\novertake. He ran him into a blind channel, in the bed of the creek where a\\r\\ntimber jam barred the way. The wolf whirled about, pivoting on his hind legs\\r\\nafter the fashion of Joe and of all cornered husky dogs, snarling and\\r\\nbristling, clipping his teeth together in a continuous and rapid succession of\\r\\nsnaps.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBuck did not attack, but circled him about and hedged him in with friendly\\r\\nadvances. The wolf was suspicious and afraid; for Buck made three of him in\\r\\nweight, while his head barely reached Buck’s shoulder. Watching his\\r\\nchance, he darted away, and the chase was resumed. Time and again he was\\r\\ncornered, and the thing repeated, though he was in poor condition, or Buck\\r\\ncould not so easily have overtaken him. He would run till Buck’s head was\\r\\neven with his flank, when he would whirl around at bay, only to dash away again\\r\\nat the first opportunity.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut in the end Buck’s pertinacity was rewarded; for the wolf, finding\\r\\nthat no harm was intended, finally sniffed noses with him. Then they became\\r\\nfriendly, and played about in the nervous, half-coy way with which fierce\\r\\nbeasts belie their fierceness. After some time of this the wolf started off at\\r\\nan easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was going somewhere. He made it\\r\\nclear to Buck that he was to come, and they ran side by side through the sombre\\r\\ntwilight, straight up the creek bed, into the gorge from which it issued, and\\r\\nacross the bleak divide where it took its rise.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level country\\r\\nwhere were great stretches of forest and many streams, and through these great\\r\\nstretches they ran steadily, hour after hour, the sun rising higher and the day\\r\\ngrowing warmer. Buck was wildly glad. He knew he was at last answering the\\r\\ncall, running by the side of his wood brother toward the place from where the\\r\\ncall surely came. Old memories were coming upon him fast, and he was stirring\\r\\nto them as of old he stirred to the realities of which they were the shadows.\\r\\nHe had done this thing before, somewhere in that other and dimly remembered\\r\\nworld, and he was doing it again, now, running free in the open, the unpacked\\r\\nearth underfoot, the wide sky overhead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey stopped by a running stream to drink, and, stopping, Buck remembered John\\r\\nThornton. He sat down. The wolf started on toward the place from where the call\\r\\nsurely came, then returned to him, sniffing noses and making actions as though\\r\\nto encourage him. But Buck turned about and started slowly on the back track.\\r\\nFor the better part of an hour the wild brother ran by his side, whining\\r\\nsoftly. Then he sat down, pointed his nose upward, and howled. It was a\\r\\nmournful howl, and as Buck held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and\\r\\nfainter until it was lost in the distance.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJohn Thornton was eating dinner when Buck dashed into camp and sprang upon him\\r\\nin a frenzy of affection, overturning him, scrambling upon him, licking his\\r\\nface, biting his hand—“playing the general tom-fool,” as John\\r\\nThornton characterized it, the while he shook Buck back and forth and cursed\\r\\nhim lovingly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor two days and nights Buck never left camp, never let Thornton out of his\\r\\nsight. He followed him about at his work, watched him while he ate, saw him\\r\\ninto his blankets at night and out of them in the morning. But after two days\\r\\nthe call in the forest began to sound more imperiously than ever. Buck’s\\r\\nrestlessness came back on him, and he was haunted by recollections of the wild\\r\\nbrother, and of the smiling land beyond the divide and the run side by side\\r\\nthrough the wide forest stretches. Once again he took to wandering in the\\r\\nwoods, but the wild brother came no more; and though he listened through long\\r\\nvigils, the mournful howl was never raised.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe began to sleep out at night, staying away from camp for days at a time; and\\r\\nonce he crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went down into the land\\r\\nof timber and streams. There he wandered for a week, seeking vainly for fresh\\r\\nsign of the wild brother, killing his meat as he travelled and travelling with\\r\\nthe long, easy lope that seems never to tire. He fished for salmon in a broad\\r\\nstream that emptied somewhere into the sea, and by this stream he killed a\\r\\nlarge black bear, blinded by the mosquitoes while likewise fishing, and raging\\r\\nthrough the forest helpless and terrible. Even so, it was a hard fight, and it\\r\\naroused the last latent remnants of Buck’s ferocity. And two days later,\\r\\nwhen he returned to his kill and found a dozen wolverenes quarrelling over the\\r\\nspoil, he scattered them like chaff; and those that fled left two behind who\\r\\nwould quarrel no more.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe blood-longing became stronger than ever before. He was a killer, a thing\\r\\nthat preyed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone, by virtue of his\\r\\nown strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where\\r\\nonly the strong survived. Because of all this he became possessed of a great\\r\\npride in himself, which communicated itself like a contagion to his physical\\r\\nbeing. It advertised itself in all his movements, was apparent in the play of\\r\\nevery muscle, spoke plainly as speech in the way he carried himself, and made\\r\\nhis glorious furry coat if anything more glorious. But for the stray brown on\\r\\nhis muzzle and above his eyes, and for the splash of white hair that ran\\r\\nmidmost down his chest, he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic wolf,\\r\\nlarger than the largest of the breed. From his St. Bernard father he had\\r\\ninherited size and weight, but it was his shepherd mother who had given shape\\r\\nto that size and weight. His muzzle was the long wolf muzzle, save that it was\\r\\nlarger than the muzzle of any wolf; and his head, somewhat broader, was the\\r\\nwolf head on a massive scale.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis cunning was wolf cunning, and wild cunning; his intelligence, shepherd\\r\\nintelligence and St. Bernard intelligence; and all this, plus an experience\\r\\ngained in the fiercest of schools, made him as formidable a creature as any\\r\\nthat roamed the wild. A carnivorous animal living on a straight meat diet, he\\r\\nwas in full flower, at the high tide of his life, overspilling with vigor and\\r\\nvirility. When Thornton passed a caressing hand along his back, a snapping and\\r\\ncrackling followed the hand, each hair discharging its pent magnetism at the\\r\\ncontact. Every part, brain and body, nerve tissue and fibre, was keyed to the\\r\\nmost exquisite pitch; and between all the parts there was a perfect equilibrium\\r\\nor adjustment. To sights and sounds and events which required action, he\\r\\nresponded with lightning-like rapidity. Quickly as a husky dog could leap to\\r\\ndefend from attack or to attack, he could leap twice as quickly. He saw the\\r\\nmovement, or heard sound, and responded in less time than another dog required\\r\\nto compass the mere seeing or hearing. He perceived and determined and\\r\\nresponded in the same instant. In point of fact the three actions of\\r\\nperceiving, determining, and responding were sequential; but so infinitesimal\\r\\nwere the intervals of time between them that they appeared simultaneous. His\\r\\nmuscles were surcharged with vitality, and snapped into play sharply, like\\r\\nsteel springs. Life streamed through him in splendid flood, glad and rampant,\\r\\nuntil it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer ecstasy and pour forth\\r\\ngenerously over the world.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Never was there such a dog,” said John Thornton one day, as the\\r\\npartners watched Buck marching out of camp.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When he was made, the mould was broke,” said Pete.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Py jingo! I t’ink so mineself,” Hans affirmed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey saw him marching out of camp, but they did not see the instant and\\r\\nterrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the secrecy\\r\\nof the forest. He no longer marched. At once he became a thing of the wild,\\r\\nstealing along softly, cat-footed, a passing shadow that appeared and\\r\\ndisappeared among the shadows. He knew how to take advantage of every cover, to\\r\\ncrawl on his belly like a snake, and like a snake to leap and strike. He could\\r\\ntake a ptarmigan from its nest, kill a rabbit as it slept, and snap in mid air\\r\\nthe little chipmunks fleeing a second too late for the trees. Fish, in open\\r\\npools, were not too quick for him; nor were beaver, mending their dams, too\\r\\nwary. He killed to eat, not from wantonness; but he preferred to eat what he\\r\\nkilled himself. So a lurking humor ran through his deeds, and it was his\\r\\ndelight to steal upon the squirrels, and, when he all but had them, to let them\\r\\ngo, chattering in mortal fear to the treetops.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs the fall of the year came on, the moose appeared in greater abundance,\\r\\nmoving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less rigorous valleys.\\r\\nBuck had already dragged down a stray part-grown calf; but he wished strongly\\r\\nfor larger and more formidable quarry, and he came upon it one day on the\\r\\ndivide at the head of the creek. A band of twenty moose had crossed over from\\r\\nthe land of streams and timber, and chief among them was a great bull. He was\\r\\nin a savage temper, and, standing over six feet from the ground, was as\\r\\nformidable an antagonist as even Buck could desire. Back and forth the bull\\r\\ntossed his great palmated antlers, branching to fourteen points and embracing\\r\\nseven feet within the tips. His small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter\\r\\nlight, while he roared with fury at sight of Buck.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFrom the bull’s side, just forward of the flank, protruded a feathered\\r\\narrow-end, which accounted for his savageness. Guided by that instinct which\\r\\ncame from the old hunting days of the primordial world, Buck proceeded to cut\\r\\nthe bull out from the herd. It was no slight task. He would bark and dance\\r\\nabout in front of the bull, just out of reach of the great antlers and of the\\r\\nterrible splay hoofs which could have stamped his life out with a single blow.\\r\\nUnable to turn his back on the fanged danger and go on, the bull would be\\r\\ndriven into paroxysms of rage. At such moments he charged Buck, who retreated\\r\\ncraftily, luring him on by a simulated inability to escape. But when he was\\r\\nthus separated from his fellows, two or three of the younger bulls would charge\\r\\nback upon Buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere is a patience of the wild—dogged, tireless, persistent as life\\r\\nitself—that holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web, the\\r\\nsnake in its coils, the panther in its ambuscade; this patience belongs\\r\\npeculiarly to life when it hunts its living food; and it belonged to Buck as he\\r\\nclung to the flank of the herd, retarding its march, irritating the young\\r\\nbulls, worrying the cows with their half-grown calves, and driving the wounded\\r\\nbull mad with helpless rage. For half a day this continued. Buck multiplied\\r\\nhimself, attacking from all sides, enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of\\r\\nmenace, cutting out his victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates, wearing\\r\\nout the patience of creatures preyed upon, which is a lesser patience than that\\r\\nof creatures preying.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the northwest (the\\r\\ndarkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long), the young\\r\\nbulls retraced their steps more and more reluctantly to the aid of their beset\\r\\nleader. The down-coming winter was harrying them on to the lower levels, and it\\r\\nseemed they could never shake off this tireless creature that held them back.\\r\\nBesides, it was not the life of the herd, or of the young bulls, that was\\r\\nthreatened. The life of only one member was demanded, which was a remoter\\r\\ninterest than their lives, and in the end they were content to pay the toll.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head, watching his\\r\\nmates—the cows he had known, the calves he had fathered, the bulls he had\\r\\nmastered—as they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading light. He\\r\\ncould not follow, for before his nose leaped the merciless fanged terror that\\r\\nwould not let him go. Three hundredweight more than half a ton he weighed; he\\r\\nhad lived a long, strong life, full of fight and struggle, and at the end he\\r\\nfaced death at the teeth of a creature whose head did not reach beyond his\\r\\ngreat knuckled knees.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFrom then on, night and day, Buck never left his prey, never gave it a\\r\\nmoment’s rest, never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or the\\r\\nshoots of young birch and willow. Nor did he give the wounded bull opportunity\\r\\nto slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling streams they crossed.\\r\\nOften, in desperation, he burst into long stretches of flight. At such times\\r\\nBuck did not attempt to stay him, but loped easily at his heels, satisfied with\\r\\nthe way the game was played, lying down when the moose stood still, attacking\\r\\nhim fiercely when he strove to eat or drink.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns, and the shambling\\r\\ntrot grew weak and weaker. He took to standing for long periods, with nose to\\r\\nthe ground and dejected ears dropped limply; and Buck found more time in which\\r\\nto get water for himself and in which to rest. At such moments, panting with\\r\\nred lolling tongue and with eyes fixed upon the big bull, it appeared to Buck\\r\\nthat a change was coming over the face of things. He could feel a new stir in\\r\\nthe land. As the moose were coming into the land, other kinds of life were\\r\\ncoming in. Forest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence. The\\r\\nnews of it was borne in upon him, not by sight, or sound, or smell, but by some\\r\\nother and subtler sense. He heard nothing, saw nothing, yet knew that the land\\r\\nwas somehow different; that through it strange things were afoot and ranging;\\r\\nand he resolved to investigate after he had finished the business in hand.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt last, at the end of the fourth day, he pulled the great moose down. For a\\r\\nday and a night he remained by the kill, eating and sleeping, turn and turn\\r\\nabout. Then, rested, refreshed and strong, he turned his face toward camp and\\r\\nJohn Thornton. He broke into the long easy lope, and went on, hour after hour,\\r\\nnever at loss for the tangled way, heading straight home through strange\\r\\ncountry with a certitude of direction that put man and his magnetic needle to\\r\\nshame.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the land.\\r\\nThere was life abroad in it different from the life which had been there\\r\\nthroughout the summer. No longer was this fact borne in upon him in some\\r\\nsubtle, mysterious way. The birds talked of it, the squirrels chattered about\\r\\nit, the very breeze whispered of it. Several times he stopped and drew in the\\r\\nfresh morning air in great sniffs, reading a message which made him leap on\\r\\nwith greater speed. He was oppressed with a sense of calamity happening, if it\\r\\nwere not calamity already happened; and as he crossed the last watershed and\\r\\ndropped down into the valley toward camp, he proceeded with greater caution.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThree miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair rippling\\r\\nand bristling, It led straight toward camp and John Thornton. Buck hurried on,\\r\\nswiftly and stealthily, every nerve straining and tense, alert to the\\r\\nmultitudinous details which told a story—all but the end. His nose gave\\r\\nhim a varying description of the passage of the life on the heels of which he\\r\\nwas travelling. He remarked the pregnant silence of the forest. The bird life\\r\\nhad flitted. The squirrels were in hiding. One only he saw,—a sleek gray\\r\\nfellow, flattened against a gray dead limb so that he seemed a part of it, a\\r\\nwoody excrescence upon the wood itself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs Buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow, his nose was\\r\\njerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped and pulled\\r\\nit. He followed the new scent into a thicket and found Nig. He was lying on his\\r\\nside, dead where he had dragged himself, an arrow protruding, head and\\r\\nfeathers, from either side of his body.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA hundred yards farther on, Buck came upon one of the sled-dogs Thornton had\\r\\nbought in Dawson. This dog was thrashing about in a death-struggle, directly on\\r\\nthe trail, and Buck passed around him without stopping. From the camp came the\\r\\nfaint sound of many voices, rising and falling in a sing-song chant. Bellying\\r\\nforward to the edge of the clearing, he found Hans, lying on his face,\\r\\nfeathered with arrows like a porcupine. At the same instant Buck peered out\\r\\nwhere the spruce-bough lodge had been and saw what made his hair leap straight\\r\\nup on his neck and shoulders. A gust of overpowering rage swept over him. He\\r\\ndid not know that he growled, but he growled aloud with a terrible ferocity.\\r\\nFor the last time in his life he allowed passion to usurp cunning and reason,\\r\\nand it was because of his great love for John Thornton that he lost his head.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce-bough lodge when they\\r\\nheard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal the like of which\\r\\nthey had never seen before. It was Buck, a live hurricane of fury, hurling\\r\\nhimself upon them in a frenzy to destroy. He sprang at the foremost man (it was\\r\\nthe chief of the Yeehats), ripping the throat wide open till the rent jugular\\r\\nspouted a fountain of blood. He did not pause to worry the victim, but ripped\\r\\nin passing, with the next bound tearing wide the throat of a second man. There\\r\\nwas no withstanding him. He plunged about in their very midst, tearing,\\r\\nrending, destroying, in constant and terrific motion which defied the arrows\\r\\nthey discharged at him. In fact, so inconceivably rapid were his movements, and\\r\\nso closely were the Indians tangled together, that they shot one another with\\r\\nthe arrows; and one young hunter, hurling a spear at Buck in mid air, drove it\\r\\nthrough the chest of another hunter with such force that the point broke\\r\\nthrough the skin of the back and stood out beyond. Then a panic seized the\\r\\nYeehats, and they fled in terror to the woods, proclaiming as they fled the\\r\\nadvent of the Evil Spirit.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd truly Buck was the Fiend incarnate, raging at their heels and dragging them\\r\\ndown like deer as they raced through the trees. It was a fateful day for the\\r\\nYeehats. They scattered far and wide over the country, and it was not till a\\r\\nweek later that the last of the survivors gathered together in a lower valley\\r\\nand counted their losses. As for Buck, wearying of the pursuit, he returned to\\r\\nthe desolated camp. He found Pete where he had been killed in his blankets in\\r\\nthe first moment of surprise. Thornton’s desperate struggle was\\r\\nfresh-written on the earth, and Buck scented every detail of it down to the\\r\\nedge of a deep pool. By the edge, head and fore feet in the water, lay Skeet,\\r\\nfaithful to the last. The pool itself, muddy and discolored from the sluice\\r\\nboxes, effectually hid what it contained, and it contained John Thornton; for\\r\\nBuck followed his trace into the water, from which no trace led away.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAll day Buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp. Death, as\\r\\na cessation of movement, as a passing out and away from the lives of the\\r\\nliving, he knew, and he knew John Thornton was dead. It left a great void in\\r\\nhim, somewhat akin to hunger, but a void which ached and ached, and which food\\r\\ncould not fill, At times, when he paused to contemplate the carcasses of the\\r\\nYeehats, he forgot the pain of it; and at such times he was aware of a great\\r\\npride in himself,—a pride greater than any he had yet experienced. He had\\r\\nkilled man, the noblest game of all, and he had killed in the face of the law\\r\\nof club and fang. He sniffed the bodies curiously. They had died so easily. It\\r\\nwas harder to kill a husky dog than them. They were no match at all, were it\\r\\nnot for their arrows and spears and clubs. Thenceforward he would be unafraid\\r\\nof them except when they bore in their hands their arrows, spears, and clubs.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNight came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky, lighting\\r\\nthe land till it lay bathed in ghostly day. And with the coming of the night,\\r\\nbrooding and mourning by the pool, Buck became alive to a stirring of the new\\r\\nlife in the forest other than that which the Yeehats had made, He stood up,\\r\\nlistening and scenting. From far away drifted a faint, sharp yelp, followed by\\r\\na chorus of similar sharp yelps. As the moments passed the yelps grew closer\\r\\nand louder. Again Buck knew them as things heard in that other world which\\r\\npersisted in his memory. He walked to the centre of the open space and\\r\\nlistened. It was the call, the many-noted call, sounding more luringly and\\r\\ncompellingly than ever before. And as never before, he was ready to obey. John\\r\\nThornton was dead. The last tie was broken. Man and the claims of man no longer\\r\\nbound him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHunting their living meat, as the Yeehats were hunting it, on the flanks of the\\r\\nmigrating moose, the wolf pack had at last crossed over from the land of\\r\\nstreams and timber and invaded Buck’s valley. Into the clearing where the\\r\\nmoonlight streamed, they poured in a silvery flood; and in the centre of the\\r\\nclearing stood Buck, motionless as a statue, waiting their coming. They were\\r\\nawed, so still and large he stood, and a moment’s pause fell, till the\\r\\nboldest one leaped straight for him. Like a flash Buck struck, breaking the\\r\\nneck. Then he stood, without movement, as before, the stricken wolf rolling in\\r\\nagony behind him. Three others tried it in sharp succession; and one after the\\r\\nother they drew back, streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward, pell-mell, crowded\\r\\ntogether, blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the prey.\\r\\nBuck’s marvellous quickness and agility stood him in good stead. Pivoting\\r\\non his hind legs, and snapping and gashing, he was everywhere at once,\\r\\npresenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly did he whirl and\\r\\nguard from side to side. But to prevent them from getting behind him, he was\\r\\nforced back, down past the pool and into the creek bed, till he brought up\\r\\nagainst a high gravel bank. He worked along to a right angle in the bank which\\r\\nthe men had made in the course of mining, and in this angle he came to bay,\\r\\nprotected on three sides and with nothing to do but face the front.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd so well did he face it, that at the end of half an hour the wolves drew\\r\\nback discomfited. The tongues of all were out and lolling, the white fangs\\r\\nshowing cruelly white in the moonlight. Some were lying down with heads raised\\r\\nand ears pricked forward; others stood on their feet, watching him; and still\\r\\nothers were lapping water from the pool. One wolf, long and lean and gray,\\r\\nadvanced cautiously, in a friendly manner, and Buck recognized the wild brother\\r\\nwith whom he had run for a night and a day. He was whining softly, and, as Buck\\r\\nwhined, they touched noses.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen an old wolf, gaunt and battle-scarred, came forward. Buck writhed his lips\\r\\ninto the preliminary of a snarl, but sniffed noses with him, Whereupon the old\\r\\nwolf sat down, pointed nose at the moon, and broke out the long wolf howl. The\\r\\nothers sat down and howled. And now the call came to Buck in unmistakable\\r\\naccents. He, too, sat down and howled. This over, he came out of his angle and\\r\\nthe pack crowded around him, sniffing in half-friendly, half-savage manner. The\\r\\nleaders lifted the yelp of the pack and sprang away into the woods. The wolves\\r\\nswung in behind, yelping in chorus. And Buck ran with them, side by side with\\r\\nthe wild brother, yelping as he ran.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd here may well end the story of Buck. The years were not many when the\\r\\nYeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves; for some were seen with\\r\\nsplashes of brown on head and muzzle, and with a rift of white centring down\\r\\nthe chest. But more remarkable than this, the Yeehats tell of a Ghost Dog that\\r\\nruns at the head of the pack. They are afraid of this Ghost Dog, for it has\\r\\ncunning greater than they, stealing from their camps in fierce winters, robbing\\r\\ntheir traps, slaying their dogs, and defying their bravest hunters.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNay, the tale grows worse. Hunters there are who fail to return to the camp,\\r\\nand hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with throats slashed\\r\\ncruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the snow greater than the\\r\\nprints of any wolf. Each fall, when the Yeehats follow the movement of the\\r\\nmoose, there is a certain valley which they never enter. And women there are\\r\\nwho become sad when the word goes over the fire of how the Evil Spirit came to\\r\\nselect that valley for an abiding-place.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the summers there is one visitor, however, to that valley, of which the\\r\\nYeehats do not know. It is a great, gloriously coated wolf, like, and yet\\r\\nunlike, all other wolves. He crosses alone from the smiling timber land and\\r\\ncomes down into an open space among the trees.
