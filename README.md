# Call of the Wild

This is the first novel of Jack London that I read when I was young. So, I want to try out some small analysis between important characters in the books.

### Method: 
```
Calculate the frequency of the characters'name in the book. 
Analyze the relationship between characters based on their name frequency in each chapter.
Visualize the development of Buck from house dog to a wild wolf.
```
